h2. Introduction

This project/plugin extends the _tsl2nano.serviceaccess_ project to access the data without any application-server - but using an o/r mapper through jpa - with javax.persistence. It provides a BeanContainer to be used to get entities mapped by jpa. BeanContainers for detaching entities and storing them local are available. The ScriptTool may be used as a kind of sql/hql/ant tool.

Another feature is providing a primitive database _replication_. For further informations have a look at the _tsl2.nano.h5_ project.

h2. Dependencies

* tsl2.nano.serviceaccess
* at least one o/r mapper like hibernate with all it's dependencies
* for the ScirptTool, the standard ant libraries are needed.
* to get a connection to a database (through javax.persistence), at least a database-driver library is needed.

h2. developing and deploying

If you change sources of this plugin, you should start ant script _eclipse-tsl2.nano.directaccess.xml_ with target _tsl2nano.eclipse.directaccess.export_ and after that the 'deploy' target of your main project.
