## Introduction

A web application on base of nano.h5  will be provided to do all service actions through an html5 gui.
The service *DocPortalService* provides its services as REST. The services are described in the next chapter.
All Client-Documents are encrypted and signed. Access is possible through certificate authentication.

NOTE: the server is only runnable on a linux system with an oracle java jdk (>=8u301) providing 'keytool' as pki cli.

### Overview

An organisation wants to provide documents to its clients. The clients should be able to download decrypt and check the authenticy. The client may upload own documents as response.

The organisation has to create a new git account on a git host like github. Therefore it needs an email address, an own certifate and a webserver providing the webapplication on base of nano.h5. As the webapplication should work on https (tls 1.2) the certificate is already available.
Some base instruction documents may be uploaded to be readable by the clients.

A new client will be initialized as new git repository. A new certifcate request will be edited by the organisation. On positive validation, the organisation sends a new client certificate to the client. The
private key of that certificate will be send by mail or email.

## repository portal (private folder)

* git (one user-account, multiple private repositories) -> storing documents encrypted with stored public key
* use of root certificate and client certificate
* up-/download of jpg/pdf documents (with {name, type, description, timestamp, seal(MAC), begin-end dates, geo-location} -> QR-code, optional text)
* folder structure (type -> name+timestampt+period+seal+geolocation, name+description)
* scan/photo document

generic own-path

* QR (Name+GPS+in-out Time) -> checkin/-out
* signed document (seal)

### service

* new organisation -> new github account, create self-signed certificate
* new account -> identity, e-mail, password, certificate -> new repository <identity>, file with user-data
* extend client certificate
* upload document
    * arget repository name, type, description, period 
    * load certificate
    * encrypt document
    * upload
* trigger email on all repository users
* browse repository
    * fetch all changes
    * fulltext fuzzy search on all entries
* download document
    * check seal on public key
    * decrypt document
    * show document
* create QR-Code on documents git url
