## Introduction

NanoH5 (or FullRelation) is an UI independent gui implementation framework providing a model driven design (MDA). It is bound to the app framework __tsl2.nano.commons__ and the jpa-service framework __tsl2.nano.serviceaccess__. It is possible to build a complete html5 application through a given class- or database-model.

- Everything will be filled for you by defaults - presenting a full application getting a database connection
- define it or implement it - all object-types have their representation as readable xml-file.
- ...or just use it as intelligent bean-browser or entity-browser

To do a quick-start, go to chapter _Starting / Test_.

### Goals
* pure model implementation + plattform independency (should work on android, too).
* small, having as less as possible static dependencies to other libraries
* everything has a default - all defaults are configurable (Convention over Configuration)
* application, session and entity behaviors are configurable
* implementation through simple java beans + optional bean presenters
* you develop ui independent, but are able to use ui dependent extensions.
* no new language to learn. knowing html5 allows to improve layout and styling.
* navigates through given beans, showing bean-lists and bean-detail dialogs.
* resolves all bean/entity relations to be browsed.
* navigation can be a configurable workflow - or simply an entity browser 
* pre-defines formatting, validation and presentation of relations
* pure html-5 (no javascript)
* pure jpa - jpa-annotations are read to resolve attribute-presentation
* independent of a special o/r mapper. all o/r mappers supporting javax.persistence with an EntityManager are usable.
* simple database replication on user-loaded data - offline working possible
* full key-navigation (shortcuts)
* framework designs interfaces and provides extendable implementations
* useable as standalone or web-service (with offline access), can connect to application-server or works standalone.
* many features through nano.common, and nano.incubation like a rule, sql, action engine, network executor etc.
* handling blobs of data (byte[]) to be presented in html as picture, audio, video or object.
* planned interfaces: 
** ddl-->beans through hibernate-tools
** jpa-->bean through annotation evaluation
** xsd-->bean (not finished yet!)
** java-interface-->java-bean (mock through internal proxy, not finished yet!)

Using the _NanoHTTPD_ Server as base, this client application creates html surfaces, sending them through the integrated server to an html browser. Entry point is the file _application.html_ defining the browser request _http://localhost:8067_ (configurable ;-)).

It is not a real web-application platform but a simple way to use html5 as graphical user interface - in a standard client application.

The base framework is [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). It is a full stack framework as simple and generic as possible - without dependencies to other libraries (except: simple-xml). 

The data access is done by:
* [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.serviceaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html)
* [tsl2.nano.directaccess](../tsl2.nano.directaccess/nano.directaccess.html)

It is possible to use an ejb container in an application server, but the default is set to use jpa directly on the client (using _tsl2nano.directaccess_).

### Why?

The base frameworks are grown through input of two industrial projects. the first project had to build a software fully configurable through a database. The second was a financial project.

tested project-environments:
* windows-xp, windows-7, windows-terminal-server, ubuntu 12
* oracle 11, hsqldb
* glassfish 2.1, toplink
* jboss-eap 6.1, hibernate

### What is it for?

this software should provide a fast way to create a standard application through a database (or class-) model. through a complete set of configuration possibilities, a user may fit this application for his requirements. respecting a small set of rules, a software-developer is able to extend that application to do more specifics.

### What this framework is not intended to be

* the web-application mode is not designed or tested for big data transfers or high network traffics.
* at the moment, only parts of the nano frameworks are used in productive applications.
* at the moment it is on construction - no guarantee can be given for any function or feature.
* no particular value is done for graphical design.

### Usable modes

* Client/Server application
* Web application for small user-groups
* Standalone or through connection to an application server
* with or without local replication database
* Usable as Entity-Browser configuring your data
* Usable as full-configurable application
* Usable as full-stack framework to develop model-driven applications

The _environment.xml_ in your current environment directory defines access-modes. F.e. _http.connection_ will define, if it is remote-accessible or not. For more informations, see [TODO].

### Third Party Libraries

Direct dependencies exist to the following libararies (contained inside the _tsl2.nano.h5.x.x.x.jar_):
* [SimpleXML xml serializer](http://simple.sourceforge.net/download/stream/doc/tutorial/tutorial.php)
* Serviceaccess using: jpa-api, connector-api, jta-api, ejb-api, interceptor-api

The following library was a helper to generate an xsd-file for the beandef-xml files.
* [Jing-Trang xml2xsd-Generator](https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list)

For more indirect dependencies, have a look at [TODO].

### Architecture

The architecture is defined by the application framework [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). The data and service layer is defined by [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.sericeaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html).

#### Model Driven Architecture (MDA))

Nano.h5 provides mechanisms to create a full configurable application from a given database definition file (ddl).

Creating an UML-Diagram with perhaps _ArgoUML_, or creating an ER-Diagram with f.e. _architect_ you may generate a ddl (database-definition) script. Nano.H5 provides an ant-script (_mda.xml_) to generate an hsqldb-database generating entity beans through hibernate-tools (script: _hibtools.xml_) for the given jdbc-connection. The ant-scripts use hibernate-tools since there are no similar possibilities on other frameworks at the moment. 

The other option would be to have an existing _beans.jar_. This could be selected on the entry- or login-page of nano-h5. If you enter an absolute path for the attribute _JarFile_ inside the _Persistence_ page, this bean-file will be used to load the entity-classes. If you enter a relative path and the given file doesn't exist, it will be generated through hibernate-tools (if hibernate is in your environment!).

##### Process Description (using hibernate-tools)

* the jdbc-driver of your database, _ant_, _hibernate_ and _hibernate-tools_ have to be in your classpath or environment directory.
* Use a tool like _ArgoUML_ or _architect_ to create an UML-Diagram 
* Export the data model to a ddl file (sql statements to create the database). This file must be stored in the environment directory with extension _sql_ (e.g. timedb.sql).
* start _mda.bat_ to generate the database from ddl file creating the beans-jar file through hibernate tools.

#### Framework mechanisms - how to extend the framework

If you connect/login to a persistence-layer/database for the first time, the framework tries to evaluate all bean-properties and attribute-properties. the order of attributes of each bean will be calculated through the implementation of _BeanPresentationHelper.getBestAttributeOrder()_. The best attribute to present the bean is done through _BeanPresentationHelper.getBestAttributeName()_.
This methods are called only if _bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter_ is true - and use the following properties of _environment.xml_:

* bean.best.attribute.type (default: String.class)
* bean.best.attribute.regexp (default:.*(name|bezeichnung|description|id).*)
* bean.best.attribute.minlength (default: 2)
* bean.best.attribute.maxlength (default: 50)

All formats, constraints and basic presentation-properties will be evaluated through the type and jpa-annotations of an attribute.

##### Configuration through Serialization

The environment and the bean-definitions are the main constructs serializing it's properties to the file-system.
...
The _BeanDefinition_ expects only _AttributeDefinition_s from deserializings - to be more readable. This  means, that extensions of AttributeDefinition are not handled!
...
On the data side, all collections are wrapped into an object of type _BeanCollector_, single instances that are prepared to be presented are wrapped into an object of type _Bean_. All attributes of a _Bean_ are wrapped into _BeanValue_s. The _BeanCollector_ and the _Bean_ are extensions of _BeanDefinition_, handling the attributes. While the used xml-serializer _Simple-XML_ is not able to create the desired root instance through reading an xml (we have to define the instance type on calling simple-xml), extensions of a _BeanDefinition_ are handled through a special mechanism, implemented in the class _Extension_.

*Tip*: If you delete your environment.xml file, it will be re-created on next restart - all beandefinitions will be re-created, too.

##### Registered services and definitions through the environment

The following services are registered through nano.h5 by default and should be acessed through the _Environment_ class, if you are developing own classes or extensions:

* _IAuthorization_: provides access to check user privileges (e.g.: hasAccess(userName, actions))
* _XmlUtil_: provides de-/serialization (default: simple-xml), xpath, velocity-generation (if found in environment!)
* _Messages_: Resource-bundles for translations
* _IGenericService_: access to entity-beans
* _CompatibilityLayer_: indirect access to extern libararies (using reflection), 
* _ClassLoader_: nano.h5 current classloader, containing all jars in your environment, including nested jars
* _UncaughtExceptionHandler_: handling/provding exceptions and messages
* _IPageBuilder_: implementation of the html5-building (here: _Html5Presentation_ as extension of _BeanPresentationHelper_)
* _Profiler_: simple profiler to log simple performance aspects

## Starting / Test

### Quick-Start

* install a java jdk at [TODOleast version 1.7]. If you only install a java jre-version, the bean-jar file cannot be generated - then you have to select an existing one.
* get the newest version of [TODOtsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z-hibernate.zip]
* extract that zip-file anywhere
* go into the extracted sub-directory _config_ and start the _Windows_-batch file _startServer.bat_. This will start the sample database.
* start _tsl2.nano.h5-x.y.z.jar_ with double-click or through the _run.bat_ (simple call of: _java -jar tsl2.nano.h5-x.y.z.jar_)
* if you are not on a _Windows_ system, start your internet browser with adress _localhost:8067_, or just do a double-click on the file _application.html_
* In the center of the browser-page do a click on the centered link, starting with text 'Start...'
* Do a login filling the user-name 'time' and password 'time' and clicking the Ok-Button.
* After a while you will see all availabe entity-types to be browsable...

### Overview

The tsl2.nano.h5 framework can be started through it's jar _tsl2.nano.h5-xxxxx.jar_. A start script _run.bat_ (will be generated on first start) is available to do this in _Windows_. Starting it, a given directory is used as a kind of workspace where you put all configuration and jar files into - to be used. This jars may be ant, an o/r-mapper like hibernate with all it's dependencies. The configuration files are _the environment.xml_ and all xml files describing the presentation of each entity bean. Icons for all buttons and backgrounds are in the _icons_ folder. The main jar file can contain all dependent jar files (as described in the manifest file) or outside in the same directory as the main jar.

On first start, the most important files will be created!

Normally, you will start with an example: download the file _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z-hibernate.zip_ to have an example using lots of features of this project - you have a simple test database and are able to generate your bean jar, see a trivial application-extension, workflow, autorization and rule.
 
Feel free to test, whether a database-connection of a project you know is working with nano.h5....

### Using the sample-content

A sample environment is contained in the _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z-hibernate.jar_ file, containing all icons, jars and configurations for a project. It may be used for other nano.h5 projects. It uses:

* ant libraries to generate entitiy beans through hibernate-tools and the sample database
* hibernate with all dependencies as o/r mapper
* hibernate-tools
* hsqldb.jar as jdbc driver for a hsqldb database
* sample databae _timedb_
* sample icons for all buttons

Before you start _nano.h5_, you should start the sample hsqldb database:

config/runServer.bat

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.database.jpg]]

To start nano.h5 you have to call it with following syntax:

java -jar tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar [environment-path (default: config] [http-server-port (default: 8067)]

This call is implemented inside the _run.bat_ script. Use that, if you are on windows. But normally, nano-h5 should be runnable through a double-click on the jar file _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_.

If you start it on _Windows_, a browser will be opened to show the initial screen:

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.start.jpg]]

If you are not on _Windows_, you should open an html-browser with file _application.html_.

Now you can login to the sample database. It is fully configurable, which o/r mapper and database should be used. After pressing Ok, a _persistence.xml_ will be generated to be found by the _javax.persistence_ implementation.

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.persistence.jpg]]

All entities of the jar-file, containing the entities, will be listed. You can filter the list and select one or more to edit them.

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.entity-types.jpg]]

Then you will get a search page with a search filter and an empty list. Pushing the search-button will create the result list.

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.entity-search.jpg]]

If you click a column header (here f.e. _comments_), the list will be sorted by this column - clicking on that column a second time, the sorting will be done in the other direction. 

The possible actions will be described in the chapter _Application and Page Actions_.

### Extending the Sample

The file _environment.xml_ defines the application behaviour. For further informations read chapter _The Environment_.
It is possible to change the presentation of each bean. Inside the environments directory _beandef_ all beans have configuration files to change their presentation and behaviour. If the file _environment.xml_ doesn't exist, the bean definitions will be created on next application start.

It is possible to create an own java project to define own application and bean behaviour. This is described in chapter _Creating an own project_.

## The Environment

Loading a _Nano.h5_ application will create and use an environment directory as workspace for it. Resources like icons, configuration xml-file and libraries will be put there - being on top of classpath.

Everything of your application will be accessible through this environment. It provides all system-/ application properties and all application services.

A description of all configuration attributes can be found [here](src/resources/environment.default.xml)

### Language and Translations

The _messages.properties_ is the language file to translate every application specific text. You can overwrite it through putting your own file into the environment-directory with sub-directory _de/tsl2/nano/h5_. All bean or bean-attribute-names will be translated. 
All framework specific and generic texts will be translated through the internal _de.tsl2.nano.messages.properties_.

## Application and Page Actions

On top of each html page you will see on the left side an application icon (clicking on it, it tries to load the help file from web). On top right, all page-specific buttons are shown. The following list tries to describe them. They depend on the current type of bean. A bean list will have other buttons than a beans detail page.

### Bean's search page top buttons

* *select all*: will select all listed items to be accessed through 'open' or 'delete' buttons
* *de-select all*: will de-select all listed items
* *next page*: if a bean search filter results in more matches than shown in this result page, the next result items will be shown
* *previous page*: if you walk through the result pages with *next-page*, you can go back until the first page.
* *switch relations*: if your current bean-list or bean-detail contains one-to-many relations (f.e. persons have collection of adresses), they can be shown now. this may result in longer page-build times! clicking the button on the same page another time will turn off the one-to-many relations.

### All other page buttons (on the top)

* *print*: shows a page with non-interactive presentation of the current page. use the browsers back-button to return to the application
* *export*: shows a page with a pure text presentation like a csv file - to be copy/pasted into another file. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *document*: if configured in _environment.xml_, a text-file (a rtf-file is possible, too) can be search and replaced with key/values of the current page.
* *configure*: opens a configuration page for the current bean. you are able to change the presentation text of this bean, all attributes to be presented - presentation properties like layout and layout constraints.
* *help*: if a help html-file for the current page/bean can be found, it will be shown. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *refresh*: all configurations will be reloaded
* *exit*: stops the current user-session.

### Bean search and manipulation buttons

* *search*: searches for all beans of the current type and filter.
* *reset*: resets all search-filter fields and the result list
* *open*: opens all selected beans. only active, if on page-creation at least one selected items is available.
* *new*: creates a new item of the given type.
* *delete*: deletes all selected items.

### Bean detail buttons

* *save*: saves the current bean.
* *close*: closes the current page, returning to the last one without saving.

### Dependencies

#### Static Dependencies (direct referenced by tsl2.nano)

* simple-xml-2.7.jar

#### Dynamic Dependencies (used by tsl2.nano, but through compatibility-layer)

* XmlUtil: velocity-1.6-dep.jar 
* CommonTest: junit-4.8.2.jar 
* AntUtil: ant-launcher.jar, ant.jar, ant-nodeps.jar 
* BeanEnhancer: javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar

#### No Dependencies, but useful to do the work

* jdbc database driver (like hsqldb.jar)
* jpa o/r mapper (like hibernate, toplink or ormlite)
* generator tool to create entity beans (like hibernate-tools)

Hibernate 4 for example would have the following dependencies:

* commons-collections-3.2.1.jar 
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar 
* commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar 
* commons-io-1.3.2.jar 
* commons-lang-2.4.jar 
* commons-codec-1.6.jar 
* dom4j-1.6.1.jar 
* javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar
* antlr.jar
 
## Runtime Configuration

## Specifying Rules, Queries and Actions to be used on Beans and Attributes

To do a structured work on a usable specification, rules, queries and actions can be defined before implementing or configuring the presentation. This is done by creating these items as xml-files inside the environments _specifiation_ directory. To see how it works, hit the applications menu button 'sample-codes' and have a look into the specification directory.

Example for a query:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<query name="personen" nativeQuery="false">
   <query><![CDATA[select p from Person p]]></query>
</query>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example for an action, starting an ant-script:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<action name="ant" declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.execution.ScriptUtil">
   <parameter name="arg1">
      <type javaType="java.lang.String"/>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="arg2">
      <type javaType="java.lang.String"/>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="arg3">
      <type javaType="java.util.Properties"/>
   </parameter>
   <constraint name="arg2">
      <definition type="java.lang.String" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <defaultValue class="java.lang.String">help</defaultValue>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <constraint name="arg1">
      <definition type="java.lang.String" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <defaultValue class="java.lang.String">C:\eigen\tsl2\tsl2-workspace\tsl2-nano\target\test.h5.sample\h5.sample/antscripts.xml</defaultValue>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <operation>ant</operation>
</action>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The _ScriptTool_

After login, you are able to execute queries and scripts like ant-scripts. You have to enable it in your _environment.xml_ to see the _ScriptTool_ in the list of _BeanCollectors_.

With _ScriptTool_ you can define and save queries which will be loaded on next start time as virtual beandefinition - means, it is inside the bean-type list.
 
## Layout and Styling

### Using CSS

Html styles can be added through import of css files. On building each html page, the file *meta-frame.html* will be searched inside the environments *css* directory: _css/meta-frame.html_.
The _meta-frame.html_ defines the html header and an empty body. Inside the header you should define the css style files you want to be used. The style files must define a class *menu* through the tags *ul* and *li*. Then, each page will have a menu at the top - instead of a button panel.

An example is provided with _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_. After first start, a css directory will be created. To turn on the given css-styling, rename the file _meta-framex.html_ to _meta-frame.html_ This is only an example - not yet working perfectly!

### Configuring Presentation, Layout and Constraints

Each bean and each bean-attribute can define a layout and layout-constraints through it's presentable object (see class _IPresentable_). It is easy to do layout definitions programmatically through the _BeanPresentationHelper_, but in this chapter we describe only the xml configuration.

TODO describe

### Bean-Collector Presentation

A bean-collector shows a set of bean-instances. The collector is defined by a bean-type or directly by a collection of items. The bit-field _mode_ defines, which actions can be done on a bean-collector.

Mode:
* _Searchable_: a search and reset action can be done on that bean-collector
* _Filter_: a table filter will be provided
* _Editable_: an open action is available
* _Creatable_: new and delete actions are available
* _Assignable_: an assign action can assign the current selection to the previous edited bean.

If an item was selected and opened, this item (a _Bean_) will be presented as detail in a new page.

#### direct queries through _QueryResult_

To define direct sql or jpa-ql queries beside the standard mechanism though compiled beans you have the possibility to show a list of values direct through _QueryResult_ which is an extension of _BeanCollector_.
_QueryResult_s can be defined through the _ScriptTool_. There you can test your queries and save it as _QueryResult_. The _QueryResult_ will be loaded into the list of available bean-collector on next application start.
 
Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<queryResult clazz="java.lang.Object" name="virtual.times-overview" isNested="false" isdefault="true" xmlns="beandef.xsd">
   <extension declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.h5.QueryResult">
      <member name="queryName">
         <object class="java.lang.String">times-overview</object>
      </member>
   </extension>
</queryResult>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples queryName _times-overview_ has to exist in directory _specification/query_.
 
#### direct controlling a set of beans through the _Controller_

The _Controller_ is an extension of _BeanCollector_ to present a collection of beans through their actions. Theses actions should be ease change-actions for attributes - like de- or increasing their values. This feature should be used for touch-screen applications.

To provide such a controller you can create an xml-file inside your environments _beandef/virtual_ directory. All beandefs inside the _virtual_ directory will be added to the bean-type list which is presented after login.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<controller clazz="org.anonymous.project.Times" name="virtual.time-actions-controller" isNested="false" isdefault="true" xmlns="beandef.xsd">
   <extension declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.h5.Controller">
      <member name="beanName">
         <object class="java.lang.String">time-actions</object>
      </member>
   </extension>
</controller>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Bean Presentation

A bean - as container of it's attributes - will always be presented as detail page. 

[TODO screenshot]

A detail page presents the attributes of a bean as it is defined in it's bean-definition xml file. for more informations see chapter _Configuration through Serialization_.

#### Value Groups and Sub-Panels

Optional a bean-definition can define value groups - a list of attributes - to be presented in its own panel.

#### Multiple Value Relations

Whether multiple value relations (one-to-many) are shown is defined inside the environments filter _default.present.attribute.multivalue_. The bean name must match the regex-filter.

### Attribute Presentation

The attributes are the most important and complex definitions. They contain the following sub-definitions:

#### Attribute Declaration

This is the most important attribute property. Normally it is standard bean-attribute, defined by the declaring class and the attribute name. The following declaration types are available:

* bean-attribute: (default) the attribute value is defined by the declaring class and the attribute name (accessed through getter and setter methods)
* virtual-attribute: the attribute value is any fixed value
* value-expression: the attribute value is defined by an expression
** path-expression: the expression is a path from a bean-attribute to another one - through one or more relations. expression example: _person.organization.name_.
** rule-expression: the expression is an existing rule name.
** sql-expression: the expression is an existing query name.

#### Constraints

The attribute constraint defines the

* _type_: attributes java type
* _nullable_: if the attributes value may be null (empty)
* _format_: an attributes value has to match the formats expression to be valid
* _length_: maximum length of input characters to be valid
* _scale, precision_: scale and precision if attribute is of type number
* _min, max, allowedValues_: the attributes value range. you may define a min and max range - or only a list of allowd values.

#### Presentable

These are generalized properties to define the presentation in any gui (graphical user interface, surface):

* _type, style_: bit-field to define a gui specific user-input
* _visible_: whether to show the attribute
* _label_: a label for the attributes input field
* _description_: an attribute description to be used f.e. as tooltip or title
* _layout_: in nano.h5: a map of html5 attributes to be set for child elements, if attribute is a container
* _layoutconstraints_: in nano.h5: a map of html5 attributes to be set for the attributes html element
* _icon_: optional icon to be shown with that attribute

#### Column-Definitions

The column-definitions describe the beans presentation in bean-table with columns - as the bean-collector do.

* _width_: column width
* _columnIndex_: at which position this column is shown (number between 0 and bean-attribute-count
* _sortIndex_: sort position, if multiple sort conditions are supported
* _isSortUpDirection_: if true, the sorting direction is _up_, otherwise _down_
* _presentable_: presentable properties like them in the attribute-constraints

#### Rule-Attributes

Rule attributes are virtual attributes showing the result of a specified rule.

##### Showing calculated values through integrated rule engine

The integrated rule engine provides calculations of rules - optional calling sub-rules - having one or more input parameter and a result value after execution. Input parameter can be constraint through java-types and value-ranges.

A rule calculates a combination of mathematical and conditioning expressions.

Example: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A1 & A2 ? ((x1 + x2) * $myrule2) : 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where A1, A2 are boolean values and x1, x2 numbers and myrule2 another referenced (using '§') rule.

Example xml-file for a rule:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<rule name="test">
   <parameter name="A">
      <type>BOOLEAN</type>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="x1">

#### Presenting data or media like images, audio, video

If an attribute holds data of type _byte[]_, it may be presented as image or any other non-textual type. The default-mechanism will declare the attributes type as _TYPE_DATA_ which will save the attributes value to a temporary file to be sent through http to the client and to be shown as image - or if a special style was defined, as _embed_, _object_, _audio_, _video_, _canvas_ or _device_ - as known from _HTML5_ embedded content tags.

## Resolving _many-to-many_ constellations

Mostly many-to-many constellations will be solved through an additional table in the middle.

Bean1(*)-->(1)Middle(1)-->(*)Bean2

_Nano.H5_ recognizes this constellations and solves the bindings through an internal mechanism called _composition_. For further informations see implementation of class _Composition_ and _BeanCollector_.
  
## Working on a page using the Keyboard

The gui provides shortcuts/hotkeys for each button to activate. As html provides basic field tabbing (of course, that depends on your browser), it should be possible to work fast using your keyboard only. Each button/action shows its hotkey/shortcut through its tooltip. The tooltip is shown positioning your mouse (;-)) cursor on the element.

On entering a search-page, the _search_ button will have always the default-focus. If a search was done, the _open_ button will have the default-focus.

On entering a detail-page, the _save_ button, if existing, will have the default-focus.

### Actions and Buttons

Each action is able to define a shortcut (keystroke). if not set, the default will be evaluated through the actions name. If that name contains a '&', the following character will be used as shortcut - if no '&' is contained and no keystroke was defined, the first character of the name will be used. E.g., if the name/label is "Clo&se", you have to hit _ALT+s_ to activate this action.

### Tableheader Buttons

Each standard table of beans will provide a table-header with Buttons to do up/down sorting (on first activation, up-sorting will be done, on second activation, down-sorting). On these Buttons we can't use the algorithm above to avoid shortcut collisions. These buttons will have shortcuts depending on their indexes. So, the first table-header column will be activated through a hit to _ALT+1_.

## Networking Modes

The _Nano.H5_ application can be started in different modes.

* *Standard Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is *localhost*. no other network node is able to connect to the application. useable as a simple client/server application.
* *Network Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using one environment and session. useable in an intranet to do some teamwork.
** *Network Multiple Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session. may be used in an intranet.
** *Network Multiple Security Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session working with ssl (under construction!). may be used in the internet.

## Authorization, Roles and Permissions

Permissions are set after connecting to the datasource through the persistence-unit. The permissions define activation of buttons and visiblity of fields. if all fields are invisible, no data and actions are available!

The application class _NanoH5_ has a method _createAuthorization()_ that defines a subject with a user-principal and it's roles, defined by permissions. If a file _[username]-permissions.xml_ is found, it will be used to fill the subject - if not, an admin-role with a wildcard-permission will permit anything!

Permissions contain a name - perhaps ended by a wildcard - and comma separated actions (a wildcard is possible, too. The permissions work on actions and data. The _BeanContainer_ provides to ask for permissions: call _BeanContainer.instance().hasPermission(name, actions) to check access to a call or to any data. The _Enviroment provides access to the implementation of _IAuthorization_. Call _Environment.get(IAuthorization.class).hasAccess(name, actions) to check for permissions.

The framework does all checks for you. But if you need extended access to authority informations, read the following details.

### Permissions on actions

To check whether a user can access a button (action) you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the id of the action. The second method parameter may be a wildcard (*) or _executable_.

### Permissions on data

To check whether an entity should be accessed by the current user, you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the class-name + toString() representation of the current object. The second method parameter tells whether to read or write the object.

## Navigation and Workflows

A navigator will guide the user through his application session. Before/after each page, the navigator will evaluate the next bean to present. This may be list of entities or simply the details of an entity.

The application can work on a simple navigation stack - a simple implementation is provided by the *EntityBrowser*. If a configuration file *workflow.xml* is found inside your environment-path, this workflow will be used, to navigate the user through his application session.

### The EntityBrowser

The EntityBrowser works on a Navigation-Stack, putting all available entity-types to the first bean-collector to be able to browse through all beans and data.

### A configured Workflow

If a configured workflow is available, this workflow will be used as navigator. 
A workflow holds one or more activities defined by an enabling *condition* and an execution *expression*. After finishing a page, all activities will be checked for their entry/enabling condition. Only one *activity* should have a positive condition. This activity will be executed. The execution will be calling an EJB-QL given by the expression and returning the result of that query as next navigation bean.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<workflow name="test.workflow">
   <activity name="timesByProject">
      <condition>project&amp;true</condition>
      <expression>select t from Times t where t.project.id = :prjname</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>prjname</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
   <activity name="organisation">
      <condition>!organisation.activated</condition>
      <expression>select p from Organisation p where ? is null</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>prjname</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
   <activity name="person">
      <condition>organisation.activated &amp; (!person.activated)</condition>
      <expression>select p from Person p where p.organisation = ?</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>organisation</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
</workflow>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All parameters are stored and given by the workflow. The following parameters will be stored automatically:
* *response* = {last user action name}
* {activity-name}.size = count of entities found by your activity expression
* {activity-name} = if your activity expression found exactly one entity, this entitiy will be referenced here.
* {activity-name}.activated = true, if this activity was already activated

Use that parameters for your activity condition.

TODO: use bean-path to inspect condition expressions like 'times.type = F'.

## Database Replication - Working Offline

It is possible to replicate the data loaded from a remote database. The environments property _use.database.replication_ must be true (default is false!). The replication will be done through a second persistence-unit 'replication' (see _mypersistence.xml_). For each user an own local replication database will be created.

The replication is done in it's own thread to avoid conflictions with the application. The O/R mapper will create all tables through bean informations. A special bean holds the information (time, id, change-type) about the changes done by the user. All data, loaded and edited by the current user will be replicated to a local database. Of course the dependent data will be replicated, too, to have a valid datastore.

The replication connection is configurable like the persistence-unit is. But at the moment, only the combination hsqldb and hibernate are tested - and it's only usable in standalone-mode - without application-server!

The replications hsqldb database will be started internally.
- database: replication-<user-name>
- port: 9898

## Using an Applicationserver

If you don't want to have a standalone appliation, you are able to use an application server like jboss. To do this you must have:

* the *application servers client libraries* must be in your classpath. so copy them to your environment directory. with jboss eap 6.1 it would be _jboss-client.jar_.
* any entity beans and _remote interfaces_ of your ejb's should be in your classpath. so copy the jar holding them to your environement directory.
* of course, the *entity beans must be deployed* to that server perhaps in an ear or war-file.
* be sure to have *tsl2.nano.serviceaccess* packed into that war-file. the service *IGenericService is essential.
* add environement property 'applicationserver.authentification.service' (default: __org.nano.[environment-name].service.remote.IUserService__) with service class name. 
* add environment property 'applicationserver.authentification.method' (default: __login__) with service method to call. this method has to have two string-parameters for user and password. the method has to call _ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(userObject, mandatorObject, subject, userRoles, features, featureInterfacePrefix)_
* on the login page input user and password
* create a *jndi.properties* file in your environment. with jboss this would look like the following:

### Example jndi for jboss eap 6.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	java.naming.factory.initial=org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory
	java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.ejb.client.naming
	java.naming.provider.url=remote://localhost:4447
	java.naming.security.principal=<jndi-prefix>
	java.naming.security.credentials=<perhaps the application name>
	jboss.naming.client.ejb.context=true
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Example authentication service method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UserService.authenticate(String user, String password) {
...
    //fill the server side ServiceFactory
    if (!ServiceFactory.isInitialized()) {
        ServiceFactory.createInstance(this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        //registriere shared und error messages
        ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproject.shared_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
        bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproduct.error_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
    }
    
    /*
     * a user session will be created on server side.
     */
    final Collection<String> userRoles = new LinkedList<String>();
    final Collection<String> mandatorFeatures = getMandatorFeatures();
    ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(null, getMandant(), null, userRoles, mandatorFeatures, null);
...
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Generating your Entities

It is possible to generate your entity beans through a tool like hibernate-tools. This is prepared in _Nano.H5_, for further informations see chapter _Model Driven Architecture (MDA))_.

If hibernate-tools creates your beans, it may create additional beans to use composed primary keys. To use them with _nano.h5_ you should extend these beans, to fill the id-bean from dependent entity fields. So, enhance the setter methods of this unique fields to fill the id-beans corresponding field, too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class MyBean {
	@Id MyBeanId id;
	@Column MyType myUniqueField;
}

class MyBeanId {
	String field1;
	String myUniqueFieldId;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
## Developing, Deploying and Debugging

* [tsl2.nano code server](git://git.code.sf.net/p/tsl2nano/code tsl2nano-code)

If you change sources of a plugin, you should start ant script _2nano.xml_. This will generate all jars to a target directory and creates the product-version _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_ into the targets test directory _test.sample.h5_.

The version is read from _build.properties_ of nano.h5.

### Help on Html5

Normally, you don't have to create html-pages by yourself, but if you are interested in html5, have a look at the following tutorials/references:
* [W3C-Html5-Reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-html-markup-20130528/Overview.html)
* [Html-5.com](http://www.html-5.com/index.html)
* [Webkompetenz](http://webkompetenz.wikidot.com/docs:html-handbuch)
* [Html5 Poster](http://www.xhtml-lab.com)

To analyse the html-page in your browser, for example in your Chrome-Browser, you can analyse components by mouse-right-click on _analyse element_ to debug and change the current bean presentation.


### jar-library dependencies

* velocity-1.6-dep.jar: XmlUtil.transform (using CompatibilityLayer)
* TODO: describe all jars!

## Creating an own project

_Nano.H5_ is based on the framework _tsl2.common_ and it's bean package. The bean package provides a generic and comfortable way to describe your user interface. If the standards of _Nano.H5_ don't fulfil your needs, you can develop own beans on top of _Nano.H5_ - without creating special gui-elements or interaction, this will be done by the framework - generating html-pages through the _BeanPresentation_ implementation. Of course, this implementation is extendable, too. Have a look at chapter _Dependencies_ to know, which jar-files you should copy to the environment directory (f.e. _h5.sample_).

If you download and unpack _test.h5.sample_, you yield an eclipse project referencing the _tsl2.nano_ jar-files.

The code above generates examples for all _nano.h5_ aspects. The generated xml-files are used in the specialized chapters as examples.

## Performance

Generic features like authorization for actions and data, filtering of columns and field, loading bitmaps etc. may slow down the application performance. The following tips may increase the performance:

set the following *environment.xml* properties:

* extract all sub-jars from main jar 'nano.h5.xxx.jar'. nested jar loading is really slow.
* if you don't need data-permissions, disable check of data-permission: *check.permission.data=false*
* set log-level to info: *default.log.level=8*
* disable multiple field/column filter: *collector.use.multiple.filter=false*
* get only 50 lines per search: *service.maxresult=50*
* ???: *bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter=false*
* turn off replication: *use.database.replication = false*

## Problems and Solutions

* Beans showing currencys with EURO can't be saved
** Set the character encoding of your browser's current page to *UTF-8*. E.g. in Chrome: Menu=>Tools=>Encoding

* (x) check starting application multiple times
** depends on the datamodel: gruppe --> grupperolle(only for specific gruppe) --> rolle
*** The new item has to be put to the list of it's parent container. This list has to be saved before the new item!
*** The beancollector now holds a 
* *Problem: Filtering on Entities doesn't work (findBetween is not able to do a between for 'entity-columns')*
* *Problem: Filtering BeanCollectors of Entities doesn't work after sorting twice*
* internationalization: english RegExpFormat, messages.properties
* (x) remove config path from environment (-->transient)
* dynamic jar-loading inside used standard jars does not work without static entry in manifest
* *Argo-UML 0.34*
** how to create ddl from model
* *PowerDesigner*
** (v) create ant-script:
*** (v) sql-statements with ddl
*** (v) hibtool hbm2java
*** (v) replace jdbc-connection-properties

* (x) *generic navigation through hsql statements*
* ( ) *bean navigation actions*
* *ERRORS*
** hsqldb 1.8 is not able to do _select max(count(color)) from Colors group by color_
** hibernate3 is - on special circumstances - not able to load fields with empty ('') strings. This results in an __java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0__
** failure: presentable.layout --> simple-xml: Transform of class java.util.LinkedHashMap not supported
** (v) failure: sorting numbers/currencies sorts as strings
** BeanPresentationHelper.defineAdditionalAttributes(): how to avoid javaassist class
** presentation not written to xml --> see first failure
** every bean gets a new beandef copy with copies of attributedefs --> attributedef evaluations for every bean!
** one-to-many: if no cascade-type is defined,the attribute should not be editable! 
* hibernate-tools generates id-beans like times-->timesid.
** (x) check for *@Id* is no standard-java-type and environment.show.id.fields is true
*** (x) BeanPresentationHelper fills all id-bean fields as virtuals to the main bean
* on export, the filtered names (like id) are given --> nullpointer
* performance/memory: create only specific bean/beanvalue instances for changed values - use definition-instances if possible.
* field-order of bean-def may change after new compile --> serializing/deserialings will differ, see CommonTest

* Value class extends attributedefinition and beanvalue
* RuleAttr --> RuleValue?
* temp value registering through environment
* all generic interfaces registered in environment (IAttributeDefinition, IBeanDefinition, IBeanContainer, ..) to be extendable

* (v) refactore attribute-def-hierarchy: attributedefinition should not extend beanattribute. what to do with beanvalue?
** how to fill virtual beans ? default-values may be checked with errors, serializings...?
* AttributeConfiguration with value-expression
* Views with expression as listing output
** DirectSQL: SQL or HQL
** TableProcessor
** LogivView: LogicTable
* JMeter as macro configuration
* html-frames as perspective (left side: beans and views)
* refactore ForwardedException. delete FormattedException. Stacktrace with member-info

* *TESTS*
** ( ) test with multi values - using best id's
** (-) test on android
*** no datasource for Sqlite available - apache BasicDatasource uses JavaBeans what is not usable on android
*** ORMLite (4.48) not usable through persistence.xml because no EntityManagerFactory/EntityManager implementation available
** languages
** on appserver
* extract apploader: common main, classloader, execution
