## Introduction

NanoH5 (or FullRelation) is an UI independent gui implementation framework providing a model driven design (MDA). It is bound to the app framework __tsl2.nano.commons__ and the jpa-service framework __tsl2.nano.serviceaccess__. It is possible to build a complete html5 application through a given class- or database-model.

- Everything will be filled for you by defaults - presenting a full application getting a database connection
- define it or implement it - all object-types have their representation as readable xml-file.

### Goals
* pure model implementation + plattform independency (works on android, too).
* small, having as less as possible static dependencies to other libraries
* everything has a default - all defaults are configurable (Convention over Configuration)
* application, session and entity behaviors are configurable
* implementation through simple java beans + optional bean presenters
* you develop ui independent, but are able to use ui dependent extensions.
* no new language to learn. knowing html5 allows to improve layout and styling.
* navigates through given beans, showing bean-lists and bean-detail dialogs.
* resolves all bean/entity relations to be browsed.
* navigation can be a configurable workflow - or simply an entity browser 
* pre-defines formatting, validation and presentation of relations
* pure html-5 (no javascript)
* pure jpa - jpa-annotations are read to resolve attribute-presentation
* independent of a special o/r mapper. all o/r mappers supporting javax.persistence with an EntityManager are usable.
* simple database replication on user-loaded data - offline working possible
* full key-navigation (shortcuts)
* framework designs interfaces and provides extendable implementations
* useable as standalone or web-service (with offline access), can connect to application-server or works standalone.
* many features through nano.common, and nano.incubation like a rule, sql, action engine, network executor etc.
* handling blobs of data (byte[]) to be presented in html as picture, audio, video or object.
* planned interfaces: 
** ddl-->beans through hibernate-tools
** jpa-->bean through annotation evaluation
** xsd-->bean (not finished yet!)
** java-interface-->java-bean (mock through internal proxy, not finished yet!)

Using the _NanoHTTPD_ Server as base, this client application creates html surfaces, sending them through the integrated server to an html browser. Entry point is the file _application.html_ defining the browser request _http://localhost:8067_.

It is not a real web-application platform but a simple way to use html5 as graphical user interface - in a standard client application.

The base framework is [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). It is a full stack framework as simple and generic as possible - without dependencies to other libraries (except: simple-xml). 

The data access is done by:
* [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.serviceaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html)
* [tsl2.nano.directaccess](../tsl2.nano.directaccess/nano.directaccess.html)

It is possible to use an ejb container in an application server, but the default is set to use jpa directly on the client (using _tsl2nano.directaccess_).

### Why?

The base frameworks are grown through input of two industrial projects. the first project had to build a software fully configurable through a database. The second was a financial project.

project-environments:
* windows-xp, windows-7, windows-terminal-server, ubuntu 12
* oracle 11, hsqldb
* glassfish 2.1, toplink
* jboss-eap 6.1, hibernate

### What is it for?

this software should provide a fast way to create a standard application through a database model. through a complete set of configuration possibilities, a user may fit this application for his requirements. respecting a small set of rules, a software-developer is able to extend that application to do more specifics.

### What this framework is not intended to be

* the web-application mode is not designed or tested for big data transfers or high network traffics.
* at the moment, only parts of the nano frameworks are used in productive applications.
* at the moment it is on construction - no guarantee can be given for any function or feature.
* no particular value is done for graphical design.

### Usable modes

* Client/Server application
* Web application for small user-groups
* Standalone or through connection to an application server
* with or without local replication database
* Usable as Entity-Browser configuring your data
* Usable as full-configurable application
* Usable as full-stack framework to develop model-driven applications

### Third Party Libraries

* [Jing-Trang xml2xsd-Generator](https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list)
* [SimpleXML xml serializer](http://simple.sourceforge.net/download/stream/doc/tutorial/tutorial.php)
* Serviceaccess using: jpa-api, connector-api, jta-api, ejb-api, interceptor-api

### Architecture

The architecture is defined by the application framework [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). The data and service layer is defined by [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.sericeaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html).

[[img src=doc/nano-h5-overview.png]]

#### Model Driven Architecture (MDA))

Nano.h5 provides mechanisms to create a full configurable application from a given database definition file (ddl).

Creating an UML-Diagram with perhaps _ArgoUML_, or creating an ER-Diagram with f.e. _architect_ you may generate a ddl script. Nano.H5 provides an ant-script (_mda.xml_) to generate a hsqldb-database and generating entity beans through hibernate-tools for the given jdbc-connection.

The other option would be to have an existing beans.jar ....

##### Process Description
* _Ant_ and _hibernate-tools_ has to be in your classpath or environment directory.
* Use a tool like _ArgoUML_ or _architect_ to create an UML-Diagram 
* Export the data model to a ddl file (sql statements to create the database). This file must be stored in the environment directory with extension _sql_ (e.g. timedb.sql).
* start _mda.bat_ to generate the database from ddl file and creating beans.jar through hibernate tools.

#### Framework mechanisms - how to extend the framework

##### Configuration through Serialization

The environment and the beandefinition are the main constructs serializing it's properties to the file-system.
...
The _BeanDefinition_ expects only _AttributeDefinition_s from deserializings - to be more readable. This  means, that extensions of AttributeDefinition are not handled!
...
On the data side, all collections are wrapped into an object of type _BeanCollector_, single instances that are prepared to be presented are wrapped into an object of type _Bean_. All attributes of a _Bean_ are wrapped into _BeanValue_s. The _BeanCollector_ and the _Bean_ are extensions of _BeanDefinition_, handling the attributes. While the used xml-serializer _Simple-XML_ is not able to create the desired root instance through reading an xml (we have to define the instance type on calling simple-xml), extensions of a _BeanDefinition_ are handled through a special mechanism, implemented in the class _Extension_.

##### Registered services and definitions through the environment

TODO...

## Starting / Test

The tsl2.nano.h5 framework can be started through it's jar _tsl2.nano.h5-xxxxx.jar_. A start script _run.bat_ is available to do this in windows. Starting it, a given directory is used as a kind of workspace where you put all configuration and jar files into to be used. This jars may be ant, an o/r-mapper like hibernate with all it's dependencies. The configuration files are the environment.xml and all xml files describing the presentation of each entity bean.  Icons for all buttons and backgrounds are in the _icon_ folder. The main jar file can contain all dependent jar files (as described in the manifest file) or outside in the same directory as the main jar.

A possible start configuratin would be:

* nano.h5 main directory with:
** tsl2.nano.h5-xxxx.jar containing all dependent jars as described in _Dependencies_
** tsl.nano.common-xxxx.jar providing bootstrap loading with special classloaders
** environment directory like the sample _h5.sample_

Normally, you will start with an example: download the file _h5.sample-hibernate-fulllibs-0.0.3.zip_ to have an example using lots of features of this project - you have a simple test database and are able to generate your bean jar, see a trivial application-extension, workflow, autorization and rule.
 
Feel free to test, whether a database-connection of a project you know is working with nano.h5....

### Sample Environment: h5.sample

A sample environment is h5.sample, containing all icons, jars and configurations for a project. It may be used for other nano.h5 projects. It uses:

* ant libraries to generate entitiy beans through hibernate-tools and the sample database
* hibernate with all dependencies as o/r mapper
* hibernate-tools
* hsqldb.jar as jdbc driver for a hsqldb database
* sample databae _timedb_
* sample icons for all buttons

Before you start nano.h5, you should start the sample hsqldb database:

h5.sample/runServer.bat

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.database.jpg]]

To start nano.h5 you have to call it with following syntax:

java -jar de.nano.h5.Loader [environment-path (default: config] [http-server-port (default: 8067)]

this call is implemented inside the _start.bat_ script. Use that, if you are on windows.
If you start it on windows, a browser will be opened to show the initial screen:

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.start.jpg]]

Now you can login to the sample database. It is fully configurable, which o/r mapper and database should be used. After pressing Ok, a _persistence.xml_ will be generated to be found by the _javax.persistence_ implementation.

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.persistence.jpg]]

All entities of the jar-file, containing the entities, will be listed. You can filter the list and select one or more to edit them. 

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.entity-types.jpg]]

Then you will get a search page with a search filter and an empty list. Pushing the search-button will create the result list.

[[img src=doc/h5.sample.entity-search.jpg]]

If you click a column header (here f.e. _comments_), the list will be sorted by this column - clicking on that column a second time, the sorting will be done in the other direction. The possible actions will be described in the next chapter.

### Extending the Sample

The file _h5.sample/environment.xml_ defines the application behaviour. For further informations read chapter _The Environment_.
It is possible to change the presentation of each bean. Inside the directory _h5.sample/beandef_ all beans have configuration files to change their presentation and behaviour. If the _beandef_ directory is empty, you can create the bean definitions by clicking on button 'exit' on the top left - this will save the current state and exits the application.

It is possible to create an own java project to define own application and bean behaviour. This is described in chapter _Creating an own project_.

## The Environment

Loading a Nano.h5 application will create and use an environment directory as workspace for it. Resources like icons, configuration xml-file and libraries will be put there - being on top of classpath.

Everything of your application will be accessible through this environment. It provides all system-/ application properties and all application services.

A full list of configuration attributes can be found [here](src/resources/environment.default.xml)

### Language and Translations

The _messages.properties_ is the language file to translate every application specific text. You can overwrite it through putting your own file into the environment-directory with sub-directory _de/tsl2/nano/h5_. All bean or bean-attribute-names will be translated. 
All framework specific and generic texts will be translated through the internal _de.tsl2.nano.messages.properties_.

## Application and Page Actions

On top of each html page you will see on the left side an application icon (clicking on it, it tries to load the help file nanoh5.html). On top right, all page-specific buttons are shown. The following list tries to describe them. They depend on the current type of bean. A bean list will have other buttons than a beans detail page.

### Bean's search page top buttons

* *select all*: will select all listed items to be accessed through 'open' or 'delete' buttons
* *de-select all*: will de-select all listed items

### All other page buttons (on the top)

* *print*: shows a page with non-interactive presentation of the current page. use the browsers back-button to return to the application
* *export*: shows a page with a pure text presentation like a csv file - to be copy/pasted into another file. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *document*: if configured in _environment.xml_, a text-file (a rtf-file is possible, too) can be search and replaced with key/values of the current page.
* *configure*: ???
* *help*: if a help html-file for the current page/bean can be found, it will be shown. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *refresh*: all configurations will be reloaded
* *exit*: saves all current configuration values - creating files to be used to change properties - and stops the current user-session.
* *configure*: goes into a configuration mode for the current page/bean.

### Bean search and manipulation buttons

* *search*: searches for all beans of the current type and filter.
* *reset*: resets all search-filter fields and the result list
* *open*: opens all selected beans. only active, if on page-creation at least one selected items is available.
* *new*: creates a new item of the given type.
* *delete*: deletes all selected items.

### Bean detail buttons

* *save*: saves the current bean.
* *close*: closes the current page, returning to the last one without saving.

### Dependencies

#### Static Dependencies (direct referenced by tsl2.nano)

* simple-xml-2.7.jar

#### Dynamic Dependencies (used by tsl2.nano, but through compatibility-layer)

* XmlUtil: velocity-1.6-dep.jar 
* CommonTest: junit-4.8.2.jar 
* AntUtil: ant-launcher.jar, ant.jar, ant-nodeps.jar 
* BeanEnhancer: javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar

#### No Dependencies, but useful to do the work

* jdbc database driver (like hsqldb.jar)
* jpa o/r mapper (like hibernate, toplink or ormlite)
* generator tool to create entity beans (like hibernate-tools)

Hibernate 4 for example would have the following dependencies:

* commons-collections-3.2.1.jar 
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar 
* commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar 
* commons-io-1.3.2.jar 
* commons-lang-2.4.jar 
* commons-codec-1.6.jar 
* dom4j-1.6.1.jar 
* javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar
* antlr.jar
 
## Specifying Rules, Queries and Actions to be used on Beans and Attributes

To do a structured work on a usable specification, rules, queries and actions can be defined before implementing or configuring the presentation. This is done by creating these items as xml-files inside the environments _specifiation_ directory. To see how it works, hit the application button 'sample-codes' and have a look into the specification directory.

## The _ScriptTool_

After login, you are able to execute queries and scripts like ant-scripts. You have to enable it in your _environment.xml_ to see the _ScriptTool_ in the list of _BeanCollectors_.

## Layout and Styling

### Using CSS

Html styles can be added through import of css files. On building each html page, the file *meta-frame.html* will be searched inside the environments *css* directory: css/meta-frame.html.
The meta-frame.html defines the html header and an empty body. Inside the header you should define the css style files you want to be used. The style files must define a class *menu* through the tags *ul* and *li*. Then, each page will have a menu at the top - instead of a button panel.

### Configuring Presentation, Layout and Constraints

Each bean and each bean-attribute can define a layout and layout-constraints through it's presentable object (see class _IPresentable_). It is easy to do layout definitions programmatically through the _BeanPresentationHelper_, but in this chapter we describe only the xml configuration.

TODO describe

### Bean-Collector Presentation

A bean-collector shows a set of bean-instances. The collector is defined by a bean-type or directly by a collection of items. The bit-field _mode_ defines, which actions can be done on a bean-collector.

Mode:
* Searchable: a search and reset action can be done on that bean-collector
* Filter: a table filter will be provided
* Editable: an open action is available
* Creatable: new and delete actions are available
* Assignable: an assign action can assign the current selection to the previous edited bean.

If an item was selected and opened, this item (a _Bean_) will be presented as detail in a new page.

#### direct queries through _QueryResult_

To define direct sql or jpa-ql queries beside the standard mechanism though compiled beans you have the possibility to show list of values direct through _QueryResult_ which is an extension of _BeanCollector_.
_QueryResult_s can be defined through the _ScriptTool_. There you can test your queries and save it as _QueryResult_. The _QueryResult_ will be loaded into the list of available bean-collector on next application start.
 
#### direct controlling a set of beans through the _Controller_

The _Controller_ is an extension of _BeanCollector_ to present a collection of beans through their actions. Theses actions should be ease change-actions for attributes - like de- or increasing their values. This feature should be used for touch-screen applications.

THIS FEATURE IS NOT USABLE YET!

### Bean Presentation

#### Multiple Value Relations

#### Value Groups and Sub-Panels

### Attribute Presentation

#### Rule-Attributes

##### Showing calculated values through integrated rule engine

#### Presenting data or media like images, audio, video

If an attribute holds data of type _byte[]_, this may be presented as image or any other non-textual type. The default-mechanism will declare the attributes type as _TYPE_DATA_ which will save the attributes value to a temporary file to be sent through http to the client and shown as image - or if a special style was defined, as embed, object, audio, video, canvas or device - as known from _HTML5_ embedded content tags.

## Working on a page using the Keyboard

The gui provides shortcuts/hotkeys for each button to activate. As html provides basic field tabbing (of course, that depends on your browser), it should be possible to work fast only with your keyboard.

On entering a search-page, the _search_ button will have always the default-focus. If a search was done, the _open_ button will have the default-focus.

On entering a detail-page, the _save_ button, if existing, will have the default-focus.

### Actions and Buttons

Each action is able to define a shortcut (keystroke). if not set, the default will be evaluated through the actions name. If that name contains a '&', the following character will be used as shortcut - if no '&' is contained and no keystroke was defined, the first character of the name will be used. E.g., if the name/label is "Clo&se", you have to hit _ALT+s_ to activate this action.

### Tableheader Buttons

Each table of beans will provide a table-header with Buttons to do up/down sorting (on first activation, up-sorting will be done, on second activation, down-sorting). On these Buttons we can't use the algorithm above to avoid shortcut collisions. These buttons will have shortcuts depending on their indexes. So, the first table-header column will be activated through a hit to _ALT+1_.

## Networking Modes

The _Nano.H5_ application can be started in different modes.

* *Standard Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is *localhost*. no other network node is able to connect to the application. useable as a simple client/server application.
* *Network Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using one environment and session. useable in an intranet to do some teamwork.
** *Network Multiple Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session. may be used in an intranet.
** *Network Multiple Security Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session working with ssl (under construction!). may be used in the internet.

## Authorization, Roles and Permissions

Permissions are set after connecting to the datasource through the persistence-unit. The permissions define activation of buttons and visiblity of fields. if all fields are invisible, no data and actions are available!

The application class _NanoH5_ has a method _createAuthorization()_ that defines a subject with a user-principal and it's roles, defined by permissions. If a file _[username]-permissions.xml_ is found, it will be used to fill the subject - if not, an admin-role with a wildcard-permission will permit anything!

Permissions contain a name - perhaps ended by a wildcard - and comma separated actions (a wildcard is possible, too. The permissions work on actions and data. The _BeanContainer_ provides to ask for permissions: call _BeanContainer.instance().hasPermission(name, actions) to check access to a call or to any data. The _Enviroment provides access to the implementation of _IAuthorization_. Call _Environment.get(IAuthorization.class).hasAccess(name, actions) to check for permissions.

The framework does all checks for you. But if you need extended access to authority informations, read the following details.

### Permissions on actions

To check whether a user can access a button (action) you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the id of the action. The second method parameter may be a wildcard (*) or _executable_.

### Permissions on data

To check whether an entity should be accessed by the current user, you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the class-name + toString() representation of the current object. The second method parameter tells whether to read or write the object.

## Navigation and Workflows

A navigator will guide the user through his application session. Before/after each page, the navigator will evaluate the next bean to present. This may be list of entities or simply the details of an entity.

The application can work on a simple navigation stack - a simple implementation is provided by the *EntityBrowser*. If a configuration file *workflow.xml* is found inside your environment-path, this workflow will be used, to navigate the user through his application session.

### The EntityBrowser

The EntityBrowser works on a Navigation-Stack, putting all available entity-types to the first bean-collector to be able to browse through all beans and data.

### A configured Workflow

If a configured workflow is available, this workflow will be used as navigator. 
A workflow holds one or more activities defined by an enabling *condition* and an execution *expression*. After finishing a page, all activities will be checked for their entry/enabling condition. Only one *activity* should have a positive condition. This activity will be executed. The execution will be calling an EJB-QL given by the expression and returning the result of that query as next navigation bean.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<workflow>
   <activity name="times">
      <condition>!times.activated</condition>
      <expression>select t from Times t where t.project.id = :prjname</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>prjname</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
</workflow>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All parameters are stored and given by the workflow. The following parameters will be stored automatically:
* *response* = {last user action name}
* {activity-name}.size = count of entities found by your activity expression
* {activity-name} = if your activity expression found exactly one entity, this entitiy will be referenced here.
* {activity-name}.activated = true, if this activity was already activated

Use that parameters for your activity condition.

TODO: use bean-path to inspect condition expressions like 'times.type = F'.

## Database Replication - Working Offline

NOT FINISHED YET

It is possible to replicate the data loaded from remote database. The replication will be done through a second persistence-unit 'replication'. For each user an own local replication database will be created.

The replication is done in it's own thread to avoid conflictions with the application. The O/R mapper will create all tables through bean informations. A special bean holds the information (time, id, change-type) about the changes done by the user. All data, loaded and edited by the current user will be replicated to a local database.

The replication connection is configurable like the persistence-unit is. But at the moment, only the combination hsqldb and hibernate are tested - and it's only usable without application-server!

The replications hsqldb database will be started internally.
- database: replication-<user-name>
- port: 9898

## Using an Applicationserver

If you don't want to have a standalone appliation, you are able to use an application server like jboss. To do this you must have:

* the *application servers client libraries* must be in your classpath. so copy them to your environment directory. with jboss eap 6.1 it would be _jboss-client.jar_.
* any entity beans and _remote interfaces_ of your ejb's should be in your classpath. so copy the jar holding them to your environement directory.
* of course, the *entity beans must be deployed* to that server perhaps in a  war-file.
* be sure to have *tsl2.nano.serviceaccess* packed into that war-file. the service *IGenericService is essential.
* add environement property 'applicationserver.authentification.service' (default: __org.nano.[environment-name].service.remote.IUserService__) with service class name. 
* add environment property 'applicationserver.authentification.method' (default: __login__) with service method to call. this method has to have two string-parameters for user and password. the method has to call _ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(userObject, mandatorObject, subject, userRoles, features, featureInterfacePrefix)_
* on the login page input user and password
* create a *jndi.properties* file in your environment. with jboss this would look like the following:

### Example jndi for jboss eap 6.1
	java.naming.factory.initial=org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory
	java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.ejb.client.naming
	java.naming.provider.url=remote://localhost:4447
	java.naming.security.principal=<jndi-prefix>
	java.naming.security.credentials=<perhaps the application name>
	jboss.naming.client.ejb.context=true

### Example authentication service method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UserService.authenticate(String user, String password) {
...
    //fill the server side ServiceFactory
    if (!ServiceFactory.isInitialized()) {
        ServiceFactory.createInstance(this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        //registriere shared und error messages
        ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproject.shared_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
        bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproduct.error_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
    }
    
    /*
     * a user session will be created on server side.
     */
    final Collection<String> userRoles = new LinkedList<String>();
    final Collection<String> mandatorFeatures = getMandatorFeatures();
    ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(null, getMandant(), null, userRoles, mandatorFeatures, null);
...
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Generating your Entities

It is possible to generate your entity beans through a tool like hibernate-tools. for an example have a look at the sample-project _nano.h5.sample_.

If hibernate-tools creates your beans, it may create additional beans to use composed primary keys. To use them with _nano.h5_ you should extend these beans, to fill the id-bean from dependent entity fields. So, enhance the setter methods of this unique fields to fill the id-beans corresponding field, too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class MyBean {
	@Id MyBeanId id;
	@Column MyType myUniqueField;
}

class MyBeanId {
	String field1;
	String myUniqueFieldId;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Developing, Deploying and Debugging

* [tsl2.nano code server](https://sourceforge.net/p/tsl2nano/code/ci/master/tree/tsl2.nano.common)

If you change sources of this plugin, you should start ant script _eclipse-tsl2.nano.h5.xml_ with target _tsl2nano.eclipse.h5.export_ and after that the 'deploy' target of your main project.

## Creating an own project

_Nano.H5_ is based on the framework _tsl2.common_ and it's bean package. The bean package provides a generic and comfortable way to describe your user interface. If the standards of _Nano.H5_ doesn't fulfil your needs, you can develop own beans on top of _Nano.H5_ - without creating special gui-elements or interaction, this will be done by the framework - generating html-pages through the _BeanPresentation_ implementation. Of course, this implementation is extendable, too. Have a look at chapter _Dependencies_ to know, which jar-files you should copy to the environment directory (f.e. _h5.sample_).

If you download and unpack _test.h5.sample_, you yield an eclipse project referencing the _tsl2.nano_ jar-files.

The implementation _Loader.java_ and _MyApp.java_ provide an own entry for the application. The _Loader_ only tells java to load _MyApp_. _MyApp_ overwrites three methods. Only _createBeanCollectors_ defines own beans and an own navigation stack.

## Performance

Generic features like authorization for actions and data, filtering of columns and field, loading bitmaps etc. may slow down the application performance. The following tips may increase the performance:

set the following *environment.xml* properties:

* extract all sub-jars from main jar 'nano.h5.xxx.jar'. nested jar loading is really slow.
* disable check of data-permission: *check.permission.data=false*
* set log-level to info: *default.log.level=8*
* disable multiple field/column filter: *collector.use.multiple.filter=false*
* get only 50 lines per search: *service.maxresult=50*
* ???: *bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter=false*
* turn off replication: *use.database.replication = false*

## Problems and Solutions

* Beans showing currencys with EURO can't be saved
** Set the character encoding of your browser's current page to *UTF-8*. E.g. in Chrome: Menu=>Tools=>Enconding
