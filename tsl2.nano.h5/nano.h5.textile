h2. Introduction

generic html5 gui implementation providing a model driven access (MDA), bound to tsl2.nano.common bean-package and tsl2.nano.serviceaccess and it's GenericService using the javax.persistence. It is possible to design a class or database model, exporting it and to start a build process resulting in a complete html application, providing a comfortable way to edit all entities and their relations.

*Goals:* 
* pure model implementation + plattform independency (works on android, too).
* really small, having as less as possible static dependencies to other libraries
* everything has a default - all defaults are configurable
* full configurable (including standard bean behaviour and all entity behaviours)
* implementation through simple java beans + optional bean presenters
* navigates through given beans, showing bean-lists and bean-detail dialogs.
* resolves all bean/entity relations to be browsed.
* pre-defines formatting, validation and presentation of relations
* pure html-5 (no javascript)
* independent of a special o/r mapper. all o/r mappers supporting javax.persistence with an EntityManager are usable.
* data replication to work offline (not finished yet!)
* full key-navigation (shortcuts)
* useable as standalone or web-service
* interfaces: 
** ddl-->beans through hibernate-tools
** jpa-->bean through annotation evaluation
** xsd-->bean (not finished yet!)
** java-interface-->java-bean (mock through internal proxy, not finished yet!)

Using the _NanoHTTPD_ Server as base, this client application creates html surfaces, sending them through the integrated server to an html browser. Entry point is the file _application.html_ defining the browser request _http://localhost:8067_.

It is not a real web-application platform but a simple way to use html5 as graphical user interface - in a standard client application.

The base framework is "tsl2.nano.common":../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html.

The data access is done by:
* "tsl2.nano.serviceaccess":../tsl2.nano.serviceaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html
* "tsl2.nano.directaccess":../tsl2.nano.directaccess/nano.directaccess.html

It is possible to use an ejb container in an application server, but the default is set to use jpa directly on the client (using _tsl2nano.directaccess_).

h3. Third Party Libraries

* "Jing-Trang xml2xsd-Generator":https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list
* "SimpleXML xml serializer":http://simple.sourceforge.net/download/stream/doc/tutorial/tutorial.php
* Serviceaccess using: jpa-api, connector-api, jta-api, ejb-api, interceptor-api

h2. Starting / Test

The tsl2.nano.h5 framework can be started through it's jar _tsl2.nano.h5-xxxxx.jar. A start script _run.bat_ is available to do this in windows. Starting it, a given directory is used as a kind of workspace where you put all configuration and jar files into to be used. This jars may be ant, an o/r-mapper like hibernate with all it's dependencies. The configuration files are the environment.xml and all xml files describing the presentation of each entity bean.  Icons for all buttons and backgrounds are in the _icon_ folder. The main jar file can contain all dependent jar files (as described in the manifest file) or outside in the same directory as the main jar.

A possible start configuratin would be:

* nano.h5 main directory with:
** tsl2.nano.h5-xxxx.jar containing all dependent jars as described in _Dependencies_
** tsl.nano.common-xxxx.jar providing bootstrap loading with special classloaders
** environment directory like the sample _h5.sample_

h3. Dependencies

h4. Static Dependencies (direct referenced by tsl2.nano)

* simple-xml-2.7.jar

h4. Dynamic Dependencies (used by tsl2.nano, but through compatibility-layer)

* XmlUtil: velocity-1.6-dep.jar 
* CommonTest: junit-4.8.2.jar 
* AntUtil: ant-launcher.jar, ant.jar, ant-nodeps.jar 
* BeanEnhancer: javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar

h4. No Dependencies, but useful to do the work

* jdbc database driver (like hsqldb.jar)
* jpa o/r mapper (like hibernate, toplink or ormlite)
* generator tool to create entity beans (like hibernate-tools)

Hibernate 4 for example would have the following dependencies:

* commons-collections-3.2.1.jar 
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar 
* commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar 
* commons-io-1.3.2.jar 
* commons-lang-2.4.jar 
* commons-codec-1.6.jar 
* dom4j-1.6.1.jar 
* javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar
* antlr.jar
 
h3. A Sample Environment: h5.sample

A sample environment is h5.sample, containing all icons, jars and configurations for a project. It may be used for other nano.h5 projects. It uses:

* ant libraries to generate entitiy beans through hibernate-tools and the sample database
* hibernate with all dependencies as o/r mapper
* hibernate-tools
* hsqldb.jar as jdbc driver for a hsqldb database
* sample databae _timedb_
* sample icons for all buttons

Before you start nano.h5, you should start the sample hsqldb database:

h5.sample/runServer.bat

!doc/h5.sample.database.jpg!

To start nano.h5 you have to call it with following syntax:

java -jar de.nano.h5.Loader [environment-path (default: config] [http-server-port (default: 8067)]

this call is implemented inside the _start.bat_ script. Use that, if you are on windows.
If you start it on windows, a browser will be opened to show the initial screen:

!doc/h5.sample.start.jpg!

Now you can login to the sample database. It is fully configurable, which o/r mapper and database should be used. After pressing Ok, a _persistence.xml_ will be generated to be found by the _javax.persistence_ implementation.

!doc/h5.sample.persistence.jpg!

All entities of the jar-file, containing the entities, will be listed. You can filter the list and select one or more to edit them. 

!doc/h5.sample.entity-types.jpg!

Then you will get a search page with a search filter and an empty list. Pushing the search-button will create the result list.

!doc/h5.sample.entity-search.jpg!

If you click a column header (here f.e. _comments_), the list will be sorted by this column - clicking on that column a second time, the sorting will be done in the other direction. The possible actions will be described in the next chapter.

h3. Extending the Sample

The file _h5.sample/environment.xml_ defines the application behaviour. For further informations read chapter _The Environment_.
It is possible to change the presentation of each bean. Inside the directory _h5.sample/beandef_ all beans have configuration files to change their presentation and behaviour. If the _beandef_ directory is empty, you can create the bean definitions by clicking on button 'exit' on the top left - this will save the current state and exits the application.

It is possible to create an own java project to define own application and bean behaviour. This is described in chapter _Creating an own project_.

h2. The Environment

Loading a Nano.h5 application will create and use an environment directory as workspace for it. Resources like icons, configuration xml-file and libraries will be put there - being on top of classpath.

A full list of configuration attributes can be found "here":src/resources/environment.default.xml

h2. Application and Page Actions

On top of each html page you will see on the left side an application icon (clicking on it, it tries to load the help file nanoh5.html). On top right, all page-specific buttons are shown. The following list tries to describe them. They depend on the current type of bean. A bean list will have other buttons than a beans detail page.

h3. Bean's search page top buttons

* *select all*: will select all listed items to be accessed through 'open' or 'delete' buttons
* *de-select all*: will de-select all listed items

h3. All other page buttons (on the top)

* *print*: shows a page with non-interactive presentation of the current page. use the browsers back-button to return to the application
* *export*: shows a page with a pure text presentation like a csv file - to be copy/pasted into another file. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *document*: if configured in _environment.xml_, a text-file (a rtf-file is possible, too) can be search and replaced with key/values of the current page.
* *configure*: ???
* *help*: if a help html-file for the current page/bean can be found, it will be shown. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *refresh*: all configurations will be reloaded
* *exit*: saves all current configuration values - creating files to be used to change properties - and stops the current user-session.
* *configure*: goes into a configuration mode for the current page/bean.

h3. Bean search and manipulation buttons

* *search*: searches for all beans of the current type and filter.
* *reset*: resets all search-filter fields and the result list
* *open*: opens all selected beans. only active, if on page-creation at least one selected items is available.
* *new*: creates a new item of the given type.
* *delete*: deletes all selected items.

h3. Bean detail buttons

* *save*: saves the current bean.
* *close*: closes the current page, returning to the last one without saving.

h2. Networking Modes

The _Nano.H5_ application can be started in different modes.

* *Standard Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is *localhost*. no other network node is able to connect to the application. useable as a simple client/server application.
* *Network Single Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using one environment and session. useable in an intranet to do some teamwork.
** *Network Multiple Access Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session. may be used in an intranet.
** *Network Multiple Security Mode:*
** environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session working with ssl (under construction!). may be used in the internet.

h2. Authorization, Roles and Permissions

Permissions are set after connecting to the datasource through the persistence-unit. The permissions define activation of buttons and visiblity of fields. if all fields are invisible, no data and actions are available!

The application class _NanoH5_ has a method _createAuthorization()_ that defines a subject with a user-principal and it's roles, defined by permissions. If a file _[username]-permissions.xml_ is found, it will be used to fill the subject - if not, an admin-role with a wildcard-permission will permit anything!

Permissions contain a name - perhaps ended by a wildcard - and comma separated actions (a wildcard is possible, too. The permissions work on actions and data. The _BeanContainer_ provides to ask for permissions: call _BeanContainer.instance().hasPermission(name, actions) to check access to a call or to any data. The _Enviroment provides access to the implementation of _IAuthorization_. Call _Environment.get(IAuthorization.class).hasAccess(name, actions) to check for permissions.

The framework does all checks for you. But if you need extended access to authority informations, read the following details.

*Permissions on actions*

To check whether a user can access a button (action) you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the id of the action. The second method parameter may be a wildcard (*) or _executable_.

*Permissions on data*

To check whether an entity should be accessed by the current user, you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the class-name + toString() representation of the current object. The second method parameter tells whether to read or write the object.

h2. Model Driven Architecture (MDA))

Nano.h5 provides mechanisms to create a full configurable application from a given database definition file (ddl).

Creating an UML-Diagram with perhaps _ArgoUML_, or creating an ER-Diagram with f.e. _architect_ you may generate a ddl script. Nano.H5 provides an ant-script (_mda.xml_) to generate a hsqldb-database and generating entity beans through hibernate-tools for the given jdbc-connection.

h2. Developing, Deploying and Debugging

* "tsl2.nano code server":https://sourceforge.net/p/tsl2nano/code/ci/master/tree/tsl2.nano.common

If you change sources of this plugin, you should start ant script _eclipse-tsl2.nano.h5.xml_ with target _tsl2nano.eclipse.h5.export_ and after that the 'deploy' target of your main project.

Normally, you don't have to create html-pages by yourself, but if you are interested in html5, have a look at the following tutorials/references:
* "W3C-Html5-Reference":http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-html-markup-20130528/Overview.html
* "Html-5.com":http://www.html-5.com/index.html
* "Webkompetenz":http://webkompetenz.wikidot.com/docs:html-handbuch
* "Html5 Poster":http://www.xhtml-lab.com

To analyse the html-page in your browser, for example in your Chrome-Browser, you can analyse components by mouse-right-click on _analyse element_ to debug and change the current bean presentation.


h3. jar-library dependencies

* velocity-1.6-dep.jar: XmlUtil.transform (using CompatibilityLayer)
* TODO: describe all jars!

h2. Creating an own project

_Nano.H5_ is based on the framework _tsl2.common_ and it's bean package. The bean package provides a generic and comfortable way to describe your user interface. If the standards of _Nano.H5_ doesn't fulfil your needs, you can develop own beans on top of _Nano.H5_ - without creating special gui-elements or interaction, this will be done by the framework - generating html-pages through the _BeanPresentation_ implementation. Of course, this implementation is extendable, too. Have a look at chapter _Dependencies_ to know, which jar-files you should copy to the environment directory (f.e. _h5.sample_).

If you download and unpack _test.h5.sample_, you yield an eclipse project referencing the _tsl2.nano_ jar-files.

The implementation _Loader.java_ and _MyApp.java_ provide an own entry for the application. The _Loader_ only tells java to load _MyApp_. _MyApp_ overwrites three methods. Only _createBeanCollectors_ defines own beans and an own navigation stack.

Here is the implementation:

*Loader*
<pre>
public class Loader extends AppLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Loader().start("my.app.MyApp", args);
    }
}
</pre>


*MyApp*
<pre>
public class MyApp extends NanoH5 {
	public MyApp() throws IOException {
	}
	public MyApp(int port, IPageBuilder<?, String> builder,
			Stack<BeanDefinition<?>> navigation) throws IOException {
		super(port, builder, navigation);
	}

	@Override
	protected BeanDefinition<?> createBeanCollectors(@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes") List<Class> beanClasses) {
		/*
		 * define own beans to present your entities another way
		 */
		Collection<Times> times = Environment.get(IBeanContainer.class).getBeans(Times.class, UNDEFINED, UNDEFINED);
		
		BeanCollector<Collection<Times>,Times> beanCollector = new BeanCollector<Collection<Times>, Times>(times, BeanCollector.MODE_ALL);
		
		AttributeDefinition space1 = beanCollector.getPresentationHelper().addSpaceValue();
		beanCollector.setAttributeFilter("creation", "dbEnd", "pause", space1.getName(), "project", "comment");
		//more fields on one line (one field has width 3)
		beanCollector.getPresentable().setLayout(MapUtil.asMap(L_GRIDWIDTH, 12));
		beanCollector.getAttribute("comment").getPresentation().setLayoutConstraints(MapUtil.asMap(ATTR_SPANCOL, 6, ATTR_BORDER, 1));
		BeanDefinition.define(beanCollector);
		
		/*
		 * define your own navigation stack
		 */
		return beanCollector;
	}
	
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        startApplication(MyApp.class, MapUtil.asMap(0, "http.port"), args);
    }
  }
</pre>

h2. Performance

Generic features like authorization for actions and data, filtering of columns and field, loading bitmaps etc. may slow down the application performance. The following tips may increase the performance:

set the following *environment.xml* properties:

* disable check of data-permission: *check.permission.data=false*
* set log-level to info: *default.log.level=8*
* disable multiple field/column filter: *collector.use.multiple.filter=false*
* get only 50 lines per search: *service.maxresult=50*
* ???: *bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter=false*
