## Introduction

NanoH5 (or FullRelation) is an UI independent gui implementation framework providing a model driven design (MDA) and following the projector pattern. Rules are used to describe any data or presentation value. NanoH5 is bound to the app framework __tsl2.nano.commons__ and the jpa-service framework __tsl2.nano.serviceaccess__. It is possible to build a complete html5 application through a given class- or database-model. An Html5 presentation layer using websockets is provided as default.

- Everything will be filled for you by defaults - presenting a full application getting a database connection through any persistence provider (jpa 2.x)
- define it or implement it - all object-types have their representation (naked objects) as readable xml-file.
- ...or just use it as intelligent bean-browser or entity-browser

To do a *quick-start*, go to chapter _Starting / Test_.

A cool way to see the power of this tool can be seen in chapter _Online Quick-Start with a great selection of Database-Models on PonyORM_.

### What does it for you?

* it starts a generic application with default mechanisms and configurations to present data (->jpa) in html5
* it provides all needed libraries for you - independent of the database and jpa-persistence tool you use
* it creates all jpa-entities for you (of course, you can use your own!)
* all (jpa) entities are configured and presented in a most reasonable way - but easily to be enhanced by you
* data is searchable and editable in a comfortable way - can be prepared to be printed and exported
* it provides several working modes: single standalone app, network/multi-user and/or access to an application-server

### Features and Technical Goals
* pure model implementation + platform independence (naked objects, works on android, too).
* small, having as less as possible static dependencies to other libraries
* using with zero code possible
* everything has a default - all defaults are configurable (Convention over Configuration)
* application, session and entity behaviors are configurable
* implementation through simple java beans + optional bean presenters
* you develop ui independent, but are able to use ui dependent extensions.
* no new language to learn. knowing html5 allows to improve layout and styling.
* navigates through given beans, showing bean-lists and bean-detail dialogs.
* resolves all bean/entity relations to be browsed.
* navigation can be a configurable workflow - or simply an entity browser 
* pre-defines formatting, validation and presentation of relations
* pure html-5 (no javascript, only html5-scripting-api for websockets)
* jvm scripts like javascript, groovy and python can be included by rules using the java scriptengine
* using websockets to show status messages, input-assist and dependency field or timer refreshing
* using websockets to provide a chat system
* pure jpa - jpa-annotations are read to resolve attribute-presentation
* independent of a special o/r mapper. all o/r mappers supporting javax.persistence with an EntityManager are usable.
* simple database replication on user-loaded data - offline working possible
* full key-navigation (shortcuts)
* framework designs interfaces and provides extendable implementations
* useable as standalone or web-service (with offline access), can connect to application-server or works standalone.
* many features through nano.common, and nano.incubation like a rule, sql, action engine, network executor etc.
* resolves all external (jdbc-drivers, etc.) jar-dependencies on runtime on an available network connection
* handling blobs of data (byte[]) to be presented in html as picture, audio, video or object.
* providing attributes as virtuals (not bound to a real bean-attribute, rule-expressions, sql-query-expressions and RESTful-service-call-expressions
* automatic translations through network connection
* secure connection over https and wss (_app.ssl.activate=true)
* supporting yaml on environment and bean configurations.
* update mechanism
* injecting own logic on the forms html dom document
* inject onw logic in all phases of presenting through annotations
* show complex dialogs through websockets to edit beans without leaving the current page
* REST service for access/modification of all loaded entities
* planned interfaces:
	* xsd-->bean
	* java-interface-->java-bean (mock through internal proxy)

Using the _NanoHTTPD_ Server as base, this client application creates html surfaces, sending them through the integrated server to an html browser. Entry point is the file _application.html_ defining the browser request _http://localhost:8067_ (configurable ;-)).

It is not a real web-application platform but a simple way to use html5 as graphical user interface - in a standard client application.

The base framework is [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). It is a full stack framework as simple and generic as possible - without dependencies to other libraries (except: simple-xml). 

The data access is done by:
* [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.serviceaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html)
* [tsl2.nano.directaccess](../tsl2.nano.directaccess/nano.directaccess.html)

It is possible to use an ejb container in an application server, but the default is set to use jpa (through any persistence provider) directly on the client (using _tsl2nano.directaccess_).

### Why?

The base frameworks are grown through input of two industrial projects. the first project had to build a software fully configurable through a database. The second was a financial project.

tested project-environments:
* windows-xp, windows-7, windows-terminal-server, ubuntu 12
* oracle 11, hsqldb
* glassfish 2.1, toplink
* jboss-eap 6.1, hibernate

### What is it for?

this software should provide a fast way to create a standard application through a database (or class-) model. through a complete set of configuration possibilities, a user may fit this application for his requirements. respecting a small set of rules, a software-developer is able to extend that application to do more specifics.

#### It is a full stack framework, but you can use it for other simple use cases:

* as an entity/database browser or editor
* as an JPQL or SQL statement tester with the integrated *ScriptTool*
* as a test base to check your model on different jpa persistence providers like *hibernate*, *elcipselink*, *openjpa*, *datanucleus* or *batoo*. you can switch between them with three mouseclicks.
* as a quick solution to generate your entity beans through the given database connection and to test that model.
* as a test-system, using an origin beans-jar-file to rebuild database on your local system on any database - transferring needed data through replication. all done in background for you.

...all available without any application server!

### What this framework is not intended to be

* the web-application mode is not designed or tested for big data transfers or high network traffics.
* at the moment it is on construction - no guarantee can be given for any function or feature.
* no particular value is done for graphical design.

### Usable modes

* Client/Server application
* Web application for small user-groups
* Standalone or through connection to an application server
* Application, started through a rest service in a web container (e.g. in jboss: http://localhost:8080/tsl2.nano.h5.1.0.0/web/start/user.home/free.port)
* with or without local replication database
* Usable as Entity-Browser configuring your data
* Usable as full-configurable application
* Usable as full-stack framework to develop model-driven applications
* Provides a JNLP file for Java Web Start
 
The _environment.xml_ in your current environment directory defines access-modes. F.e. _http.connection_ will define, if it is remote-accessible or not. For more informations, see chapter _The Environment_.

#### Secure Connections over HTTPS and WSS

It is possible to activate a secured connection with TLS (SSL). The following environment properties can be set:
* *app.ssl.activate*: activates https connections
* *app.ssl.keystore.file*: defines the name of the keystore to be used for the secured connection. default is *nanoh5.pks*
* *app.ssl.keystore.password*: defines the password to access the keystore. default is *nanoh5*
* *app.ssl.protocol*: SSLv3 or TLSv1_1 or TLSv1_2 (default)

A default (nanoh5.pks and nanoh5.jks) keystore is included in the environment, but you can create your own self-signed keystore using the java keytool:

* be sure to have a permissions file for your user in the environment directory (e.g.: MUSTER-permissions.xml)
* be sure to change host-name inside 'environment.xml'. remove all findings of 'localhost'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias nanoh5 -keystore nanoh5.jks -storepass nanoh5 -keysize 2048 -ext SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1  -validity 9999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This java propietary JKS key can be converted to PKCS12 with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore nanoh5.jks -destkeystore nanoh5.jks -deststoretype pkcs12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, the keystore and the password are contained in the environment directory. you should constrain the environment directory to only be readable by administrators.

To let the websocket communicate between your client (browser) and the nano-server, you have to add the pks keystore as certificate into your browser!

To test the websocket use the echo site https://www.websocket.org/echo.html.

To test the available ciphers: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 {HOSTNAME}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add debugging informations: -Djavax.net.debug=all

##### Import the nanoh5.pks certificate into your google Chrome browser

* Menu->Properties
* click on the last Extended button
* manage certificates
* import and select the nanoh5.pks file (that has to be extracted previously from the tsl2.nano...jar file)
* enter the password 'nanoh5' and click all 'next' buttons until finish

##### Import the nanoh5.pks certificate into your Internet-Explorer or Edge browser

* start internet explorer (not edge!) and open your site
* if a certification error is shown in your address line, click on it
* import your certificate (for the current user and let the store be selected automatically)
* restart browser

The other way:
* go to internet options
* activate the tab 'content'
* got to certificates
* import and select the nanoh5.pks file (that has to be extracted previously from the tsl2.nano...jar file)
* enter the password 'nanoh5' and click all 'next' buttons until finish

*Note*: use _127.0.0.1_ instead of _localhost_

##### Import the nanoh5.pks certificate into your Firefox

* open your site and, on error click on 'add exception'
* restart the browser

#### Provided Start Packages

_This text is included in the README.txt of the nano.h5 download directory_

package description:
- *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>.jar*: base "nano.h5" application. needs internet access on first use to download jdbc-drivers, ant and a jpa implementation.
-  *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>-standalone.jar*: includes base "nano.h5" application with ant, a jdbc-driver for hsqldb and libraries to work without internet access.
-  *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>-signed.jar*: same as *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>-standalone.jar* but with signed content to be accessable through webstart (*nano.h5.jnlp*)
- *nano.h5.jnlp*: java webstart descriptor to start *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>-signed.jar*. will create its environment directory in its download directory.
- *sishell.<version-number>.jar*: "Structured Input Shell", a terminal application as toolbox for configurations, start scripts and administration. It is also integrated in *tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>.jar*, but without starting support.  

##### The default database HSQLDB or H2

Inside the standalone package, the driver for _hsqldb_ is included. If you use this database as default, the database will be started and initialized for you - if there are scripts found with the given database name.

It is possible to work on _H2_ as database, that will be started and initialized - but the driver is not included in the standalone package. So you have to be online to be downloaded by nano.h5 - or you have to put the driver by yourself into the environment directory. 
As URL you should input the following path:

	jdbc:h2:tcp://<host>:<9092>/<database-name>

for example:

	jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/anyway

on default (see mda.xml) a h2-tool web-server will be provided at port 8082. if not, you can start that server-tool inside your environment directory through:
	
	java -cp * org.h2.tools.Server
	
to access the database from other than local and if you want to start sql-statements directly:

	java -cp * org.h2.tools.Server  -web -webDaemon -tcp -tcpPort ${jdbc.port} -tcpAllowOthers -trace
 

#### Commandline arguments

start parameters:

`java [-Denv.user.home=true] -jar tsl2.nano.h5.<version>.jar [environment-path (default: .nanoh5.environment] [http-server-port (default: 8067)]`

This call is implemented inside the _run.bat_ script. Use that, if you are on windows. But normally, nano-h5 should be runnable through a double-click on the jar file _tsl2.nano.h5.<version-number>.jar_.

If you start it on _Windows_, a browser will be opened to show the initial screen. On other systems you should open an html-browser with file <environment-path>/temp/_application.html_ or directly with: *http://<hostname>:<port>* (default: http://localhost:8067).

Start parameter can be given in several ways. The main arguments will be concatenated through the following rule:
 1. META-INF/MANIFEST.MF:Main-Arguments
 2. System.getProperties("apploader.args")
 3. main(args) the real command line arguments

### Third Party Libraries

Direct dependencies exist to the following libararies (contained inside the _tsl2.nano.h5.x.x.x.jar_):
* [SimpleXML xml serializer](http://simple.sourceforge.net/download/stream/doc/tutorial/tutorial.php)
* Serviceaccess using: jpa-api, connector-api, jta-api, ejb-api, interceptor-api

The following library was a helper to generate an xsd-file for the beandef-xml files.
* [Jing-Trang xml2xsd-Generator](https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list)

For more indirect dependencies, have a look at chapter _Dependencies_.

#### JPA Persistence-Providers

At the moment, tested with JPA 2.0 providers, the following providers are known to implement *javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider*:

* [Hibernate  ]: _org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence_
* [OpenJPA    ]: http://openjpa.apache.org: _org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl_. For further informations on reverse engineering see http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.3.0/apidocs/ or http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.2.1/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_pc_reverse.html.
* [EclipseLink]: http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink _org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider_
* [TopLink    ]: _oracle.toplink.essentials.PersistenceProvider_
* [Acme Pers. ]: _com.acme.persistence_
* [DataNucleus]: http://www.datanucleus.org/ _org.datanucleus.api.jpa.PersistenceProviderImpl_
* [Batoo-JPA  ]: http://batoo.org _org.batoo.jpa.core.BatooPersistenceProvider_

Other smaller frameworks provide only access to JPA-Annotations without providing an EntityManager and JP-QL:

* [ORMLite]: http://ormlite.com _de.tsl2.nano.ormliteprovider.EntityManager_
	* only field annotations, no OneToMany
* [EBean  ]: http://www.avaje.org _de.tsl2.nano.ebeanprovider.EntityManager_

this ORM tools don't implement a jpa-persistenc-provider, but the libraries _tsl2.nano.ormliteprovider_ and _de.tsl2.nano.ebeanprovider_ extend the puristic base implementation of _NanoEntityManagerFactory_. Only native-SQL (no JP-QL) is available! As _tsl2.nano_ works on JP-QL, some simple transformations to native SQL are done by that EntityManager. These ORM-Tools are provided to have lightweight alternatives for mobile systems like Android.

A summary of lightweight ORM tools can be read here: ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/library/medoc.ustuttgart_fi/FACH-0147/FACH-0147.pdf

### Architecture

The architecture is defined by the application framework [tsl2.nano.common](../tsl2.nano.common/nano.common.html). The data and service layer is defined by [tsl2.nano.serviceaccess](../tsl2.nano.sericeaccess/nano.serviceaccess.html).

[[img src=nano-h5-overview.png]]

The base for the model is any JPA-provider, the presentation of entity-beans will be configured through xml (using simple-xml as xml-persister and prefilling the beans with usable defaults). The presentation follows the projector pattern.

#### Model Driven Architecture (MDA))

Nano.h5 provides mechanisms to create a full configurable application from a given database definition file (ddl).

Creating an UML-Diagram with perhaps _ArgoUML_, or creating an ER-Diagram with f.e. _architect_ you may generate a ddl (database-definition) script. Nano.H5 provides an ant-script (_mda.xml_) to generate an hsqldb-database generating entity beans through hibernate-tools or openjpa (script: _reverse-eng.xml_) for the given jdbc-connection. The ant-scripts use hibernate-tools or openjpa since there are no similar possibilities on other frameworks at the moment. We prefer the reverse engineering on _openjpa_ because there are lots of options to be set.

The other option would be to have an existing _beans.jar_. This could be selected on the entry- or login-page of nano-h5. If you enter an absolute path for the attribute _JarFile_ inside the _Persistence_ page, this bean-file will be used to load the entity-classes. If you enter a relative path and the given file doesn't exist, it will be generated through hibernate-tools (if hibernate is in your environment!).

##### Process Description

0. perhaps create a new datamodel (use a tool like _ArgoUML_ or _architect_ to create an UML-Diagram) and export the resulting ddl-file to your new  environment directory of nano.h5. the filename must end with .sql
1. start the nano.h5 application
2. input your database connection url and user/password (if you don't change anything, the __anyway__ sample databae will be created and used
3. if you want a specific jpa-provider or generation tool, change that in the bottom panel
4. click the *OK* Button to start the first process

Now, the following will be done:

* nano.h5 downloads maven (~6MB) to load the following libraries:
* jdbc-driver (~1MB)
* ant (~2MB)
* the generator tool *hibernate-tools* (12MB) or *openjpa* (6MB)
* if the database-url points to a local database and it is an hsqldb or h2, the database will be downloaded, started and created throuth the given ddl-scripts (*.sql)
* if the given beans jar-file wasn't found, it will be created through the selected generator.
* now you see a list of available entities to work on

#### Framework mechanisms - how to extend the framework

##### What is a Bean?

In java a bean is a type/class defined by attributes (=properties). These attributes are readable through getter-methods ('get' + attribute-name) and changeable through setter methods ('set' + attribute-name).

_Nano.H5_ tries to change coppling between beans and attributes. A bean, defined by it's compiled class can have additional attributes to be presented. JPA annotations are interpreted to constrain the  java-bean attributes and an additional presentation interface defines the layout of beans and attributes.

##### Where to get java entity beans from

###### Having a database connection and/or a ddl

If you don't give a beans-jar-file, nano.h5 tries to create the beans for you - using hibernate-tools or openjpa.

###### Having data stored in xml files

If you have xml files but no xsd schema definitions, create them through trang.jar. Download trang.jar, open a command line and go into the directory holding the data xml files:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
java -jar trang.jar .* <myxsdfilename>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With an xsd file you are able to generate java classes through jaxb, which is integrated in oracles java implementation. the command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
xjc -d <src-base-directory> <xsd-schema-file>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will generate the desired java classes into _src-base_directory_.

##### Which bean attributes should be presented on default

If you connect/login to a persistence-layer/database for the first time, the framework tries to evaluate all bean-properties and attribute-properties. the order of attributes of each bean will be calculated through the implementation of _BeanPresentationHelper.getBestAttributeOrder()_. The best attribute to present the bean is done through _BeanPresentationHelper.getBestAttributeName()_.
This methods are called only if _bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter_ is true - and use the following properties of _environment.xml_:

* bean.best.attribute.type (default: String.class)
* bean.best.attribute.regexp (default:.*(name|bezeichnung|description|id).*)
* bean.best.attribute.minlength (default: 2)
* bean.best.attribute.maxlength (default: 99)

All formats, constraints and basic presentation-properties will be evaluated through the type and jpa-annotations of an attribute.

*Rules on evaluating the best order*
1. attr.id() || attr.unique()
2. !attr.nullable()
3. !attr.isRelation()
4. bean.best.attribute.type (default: String.class)
5. bean.best.attribute.regexp (default:.*(name|bezeichnung|description|id).*)
6.a. bean.best.attribute.minlength (default: 2)
6.b. bean.best.attribute.maxlength (default: 99)
7. attr.getConstraint().getPrecision() > 0
8. attr.getType().isInterface()
	|| (!BeanUtil.isStandardType(attr.getType()) && !BeanClass.hasDefaultConstructor(attr.getType()))
	|| (!attr.isVirtual() && isGeneratedValue(bean.getDeclaringClass(), names[i])))
9. attr.isMultiValue() //always the multivalues at the end!

The found best attribute will be checked against an available database to be unique inside the current table-data.

##### Configuration through Serialization

The environment and the bean-definitions are the main constructs serializing it's properties to the file-system.
...
The _BeanDefinition_ expects only _AttributeDefinition_s from deserializings - to be more readable. This  means, that extensions of AttributeDefinition are not handled!
...
On the data side, all collections are wrapped into an object of type _BeanCollector_, single instances that are prepared to be presented are wrapped into an object of type _Bean_. All attributes of a _Bean_ are wrapped into _BeanValue_s. The _BeanCollector_ and the _Bean_ are extensions of _BeanDefinition_, handling the attributes. While the used xml-serializer _Simple-XML_ is not able to create the desired root instance through reading an xml (we have to define the instance type on calling simple-xml), extensions of a _BeanDefinition_ are handled through a special mechanism, implemented in the class _Extension_.

*Tip*: If you delete your environment.xml file, it will be re-created on next restart - all beandefinitions will be re-created, too.

##### Configuration through YAML

On default, all configuration and serialization files are stored into and read from xml, having style definitions through xsd files. if you wish to work on more human readable files, you can switch to *YAML*. The *snakeyaml* library is included into the framework. If you switch to YAML, all existing xml configuration and serialization files will be ignored!

To switch to yaml, change the following environment property:

	app.configuration.persist.yaml=true
	
On starting the application, the environment doesn't not know whether to load from xml or yaml - not having load the environment properties yet. so it tries to load first from xml and the from yaml.

A simple bean-definition configuration file will then look like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!<BeanDefinition>
attributeDefinitions:
  myattribute: !<AttributeDefinition>
    attribute: !<BeanAttribute>
      declaringClass: &id002 {name: de.tsl2.nano.test.TypeBean}

##### Registered services and definitions through the environment

The following services are registered through nano.h5 by default and should be acessed through the _Environment_ class, if you are developing own classes or extensions:

* _IAuthorization_: provides access to check user privileges (e.g.: hasAccess(userName, actions))
* _XmlUtil_: provides de-/serialization (default: simple-xml), xpath, velocity-generation (if found in environment!)
* _Messages_: Resource-bundles for translations
* _IGenericService_: access to entity-beans
* _CompatibilityLayer_: indirect access to extern libararies (using reflection), 
* _ClassLoader_: nano.h5 current classloader, containing all jars in your environment, including nested jars
* _UncaughtExceptionHandler_: handling/provding exceptions and messages
* _IPageBuilder_: implementation of the html5-building (here: _Html5Presentation_ as extension of _BeanPresentationHelper_)
* _Profiler_: simple profiler to log simple performance aspects

The following service may be set to override the default mechanisms:
* IConnector: defines the login/authentication. On default, the NanoH5 main instance is providing that through an Persistence instance.
* Workflow: defines the navigation stack. On default a simple entity browser is used.
* IGenericService: generic service to modify/query beans from
* EntityManager: will be invoked into the GenericeService implementation. On default, the _javax.persistence_ will be used by calling _Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(persistenceUnitName).createEntityManager()_. If the desired orm framework doesn't provide a javax.persistence implementation, a simple _EntityManager_ implementation can be set (see project _tsl2.nano.directaccess_ class tsl2.nano.persistence.provider.NanoEntityManagerFactory).

##### REST service

There is a REST service, providing access/modification for all loaded entities.

## Starting / Test

### Quick-Start

* install a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">java jdk at least version 1.7</a>. If you only install a java jre-version, the bean-jar file cannot be generated - then you have to select an existing one.
* get the newest version of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano/">tsl2.nano.h5</a>
* start this jar file with _java -jar tsl2.nano.h5.[version-number].jar_. this will create the environments _nanoh5.environment_ and a _run.bat_.
* go into the extracted sub-directory _sample_ and start the _Windows_-batch file _runServer.cmd_. This will start the sample database.
* start the _run.bat_
* if you are not on a _Windows_ system, start your internet browser with adress _localhost:8067_, or just do a double-click on the file _application.html_
* In the center of the browser-page do a click on the centered link, starting with text 'Start...'
* Do a login filling the user-name 'time' and password 'time' and clicking the Ok-Button.
* After a while you will see all availabe entity-types to be browsable...

### Online Quick-Start with a great selection of Database-Models on PonyORM

There are some online database-model creation/using provider like PonyORM (ponyorm.com) and ERDPlus (erdplus.com). This may be a fast possibility to see different database models working in tsl2.nano.h5.

Since most UML-model designers will generate a DDL (database definition language) script which may use a specific database dialect, we try to use HSqldb as local database server with compatibility modes switched on. See _Database Providers and Dialects_ for more informations.

Here is a short description how to use a model from PonyORM and starting a full database-application with web-start on that model:

 - using java 8, you have to add the tsl2.nano site from sourceforge *https://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano/* to the exception list, to start jnlp without a real certification (only a self-certification is available, yet!)
 - open the link https://editor.ponyorm.com/user/pony/OnlineStore in your browser
 - select a datbase dialect on the top tab panel and click on it (prefered: oracle)
 - click the button _select all_
 - copy the selection to the clipboard using _Ctrl+C_ or simply with the context menu of a right-mouse-click on the selection
 - go to the tsl2.nano.h5 documentation page https://sourceforge.net/p/tsl2nano/wiki/Home/ and click on the link _Start Nano.H5 through WebStart_ http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano/files/1.1.0-beta/nano.h5.jnlp
 - after a while, Nano.H5 will open a page in your browser. click on the centered link of that page
 - expand the detail panel
 - click into the field _Database_
 - paste the text from clipboard with Ctrl+V  or simply using the context menu of a right-mouse click on the field
 - click on the _OK_ Button at the bottom
 - after some minutes, Nano.H5 should show a list of available beans/tables.
 - open a type, create a new bean and click 'configure' to configure the presentation of this bean type.
 
#### Known Problems on HsqlDB/H2 compatibility mode or DDL scripts provided by PonyORM

* don't use SQL/DB-Keywords (select, where, like begin, end, day, from, until, date, order...) in your table- or column-names
*     mysql   : AUTO_INCREMENT must be before PRIMARY KEY
*     postgres: BYTEA <-- unknown
*     oracle  : Triggers with :NEW
* add __;IGNORECASE=TRUE;DATABASE_TO_UPPER=FALSE__ to the url if your DDL uses quotationmarks on tables/columns
* set the hibernate dialect to the DDL script flavour

### Overview

The tsl2.nano.h5 framework can be started through it's jar _tsl2.nano.h5-xxxxx.jar_. A start script _run.bat_ (will be generated on first start) is available to do this in _Windows_. Starting it, a given directory is used as a kind of workspace where you put all configuration and jar files into - to be used. This jars may be ant, an o/r-mapper like hibernate with all it's dependencies. The configuration files are _the environment.xml_ and all xml files describing the presentation of each entity bean. Icons for all buttons and backgrounds are in the _icons_ folder. The main jar file can contain all dependent jar files (as described in the manifest file) or outside in the same directory as the main jar.

On first start, the most important files will be created!

Normally, you will start with an example: download the file _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z-hibernate.zip_ to have an example using lots of features of this project - you have a simple test database and are able to generate your bean jar, see a trivial application-extension, workflow, autorization and rule.
 
Feel free to test, whether a database-connection of a project you know is working with nano.h5....

### Using the sample-content

A sample environment is contained in the _tsl2.nano.h5.<version>.jar_ file, containing all icons, jars and configurations for a project. It may be used for other nano.h5 projects. It uses:

* ant libraries to generate entitiy beans through hibernate-tools and the sample database
* hibernate with all dependencies as o/r mapper
* hibernate-tools
* hsqldb.jar as jdbc driver for a hsqldb database
* sample databae _anyway_
* sample icons for all buttons

_nano.h5_, will start the sample hsqldb database for you calling the script:

<environment-directory>/runServer.cmd

[[img src=h5.sample.database.jpg alt=sample-database]]

To start nano.h5 you have to call it with following syntax:

`java -jar tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar [environment-path (default: .nanoh5.environment | env.user.home] [http-server-port (default: 8067)]`

This call is implemented inside the _run.bat_ script. Use that, if you are on windows. But normally, nano-h5 should be runnable through a double-click on the jar file _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_.

If you start it on _Windows_, a browser will be opened to show the initial screen:

[[img src=h5.sample.start.jpg alt=sample-database]]

If you are not on _Windows_, you should open an html-browser with file _application.html_.

Now you can login to the sample database. It is fully configurable, which o/r mapper and database should be used. After pressing Ok, a _persistence.xml_ will be generated to be found by the _javax.persistence_ implementation.

[[img src=h5.sample.persistence.jpg]]

All entities of the jar-file, containing the entities, will be listed. You can filter the list and select one or more to edit them.

[[img src=h5.sample.entity-types.jpg]]

Then you will get a search page with a search filter and an empty list. Pushing the search-button will create the result list.

[[img src=h5.sample.entity-search.jpg]]

If you click a column header (here f.e. _comments_), the list will be sorted by this column - clicking on that column a second time, the sorting will be done in the other direction. 

The possible actions will be described in the chapter _Application and Page Actions_.

### Extending the Sample

The file _environment.xml_ defines the application behaviour. For further informations read chapter _The Environment_.
It is possible to change the presentation of each bean. Inside the environments directory _beandef_ all beans have configuration files to change their presentation and behaviour. If the file _environment.xml_ doesn't exist, the bean definitions will be created on next application start.

It is possible to create an own java project to define own application and bean behaviour. This is described in chapter _Creating an own project_.

## The Environment

Loading a _Nano.h5_ application will create and use an environment directory as workspace for it. Resources like icons, configuration xml-file and libraries will be put there - being on top of classpath.

Everything of your application will be accessible through this environment. It provides all system-/ application properties and all application services.

A description of all configuration attributes can be found [here](src/resources/environment.default.xml)

### The Login

The environment defines, how to show the login page:

	app.login.administration	true
	app.login.use.gui			true

The default _app.login.administration_ value is true. all database and persistence properties are editable and visible. If you switch it to _false_, only a simple user login with name and password are available.

#### Login with secure Authentification

On default, then environment property __app.login.secure__ is false. All persistence user will be added to __users.xml__.
If you set it to true, the synthetic user will be the user asked by the login. If user, hashed password and validity time-period are ok, the mapped real database user will be evaluated to be given to the persistence provider. 

To create a hash for a new password start the following:
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	java -cp tsl2.nano.h5.1.1.0-standalone.jar de.tsl2.nano.h5.User mypassword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This hashcode then can be used inside the __usercheck.xml for the synthetic user:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<users>
   <mapping>
      <auth>
         <name>MUSTER</name>
         <passwd>84d0e5950bde3076bdba0e0753af62cd939dadc4</passwd>
         <valid>
            <start>2017-01-01 00:00:00.0 MEZ</start>
            <end>2027-12-31 23:59:59.999 MEZ</end>
         </valid>
      </auth>
      <persist>
         <name>SA</name>
         <passwd>9hjVww2ScUl/+3QU6ifjj6U+fuJAXMFGlgykQvmH8ug=</passwd>
         <valid>
            <start>2017-01-01 00:00:00.0 MEZ</start>
            <end>2027-12-31 23:59:59.999 MEZ</end>
         </valid>
      </persist>
   </mapping>
</users>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...here the synthetic auth user name was changed from default SA to MUSTER and the synthetic password was changed to the new hashcode.

### Authentication and SessionID

The session-id is a hex presentation of a hashcode through the authorization-object.

There are three methods to remember a client session, defined in environement property "app.session.id":

* *Cookie*   : (default) with a session-id
* *ETag*     : (not working allways) with a session-id
* *Client-IP*: simple client ip - not working on dynamic ips and any forwarding like in cloud systems

### Run directly into a Bean after starting a session

To jump directly into a bean like a controller or a compositor you can define the following ENV property:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
session.navigation.start.beandefinitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <property name="session.navigation.start.beandefinitions">
      <object class="java.lang.String">virtual.Controller (ValueType-Entry), Entry</object>
   </property>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
### The Session and it's context

A session will be opened after a user-login. The session stores a context, containing 'memorized' entities and search parameters of bean-collectors to a temporary file. So, search-panels will open with last search parameters. The memorized entities will be pre-selected on creating new entities, if there is a many-to-one relation.
 
### Internationalization: Languages and automatic Translations

The _messages.properties_ is the language file to translate every application specific text. You can overwrite it through putting your own file into the environment-directory. All bean or bean-attribute-names will be translated - if no presentation xml file are present. To define for example a german translation, you would create the file _messages_de.properties_ to the environment-dirctory.
All framework specific and generic texts will be translated through the internal _de.tsl2.nano.messages.properties_.

The environments file _messages.properties_ generated on new beans provides default entries for all available fields and actions. Change it to define other translations (will be done since you change the bean-definition names in the xml files directly. It is possible to add html tags like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
myfieldid=<a href=another-url.html>my-translation</a>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tip: to have a good internationalization result on generating a new environment, put your _messages.properties_ file into a new self created environment directory. This _messages.properties_ may hold some glossaries or a full specific translation.

The framework provides automatic translation through a network connection. So, if no _messages_[locale].properties_ was found in the environment directory, the framework will try to create a translation for the _messages.properties_ from english to the current locale of the java vm - only, if _tsl2nano.offline_ is not true. This machine translation is only a first try - you should inspect this file on your own. 

To create different translations you can start the virtual machine with different locales. You do that f.e. with vm-arg _set LANG=-Duser.country=FR -Duser.language=fr_.

## Application and Page Actions

On top of each html page you will see on the left side an application icon (clicking on it, it tries to load the help file from web). On top right, all page-specific buttons are shown. The following list tries to describe them. They depend on the current type of bean. A bean list will have other buttons than a beans detail page.

### Bean's search page top buttons

* *select all*: will select all listed items to be accessed through 'open' or 'delete' buttons
* *de-select all*: will de-select all listed items
* *next page*: if a bean search filter results in more matches than shown in this result page, the next result items will be shown
* *previous page*: if you walk through the result pages with *next-page*, you can go back until the first page.
* *switch relations*: if your current bean-list or bean-detail contains one-to-many relations (f.e. persons have collection of adresses), they can be shown now. this may result in longer page-build times! clicking the button on the same page another time will turn off the one-to-many relations.

### All other page buttons (on the top)

* *print*: shows a page with non-interactive presentation of the current page. use the browsers back-button to return to the application
* *export*: shows a page with a pure text presentation like a csv file - to be copy/pasted into another file. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *document*: if configured in _environment.xml_, a text-file (a rtf-file is possible, too) can be search and replaced with key/values of the current page.
* *configure*: opens a configuration page for the current bean. you are able to change the presentation text of this bean, all attributes to be presented - presentation properties like layout and layout constraints.
* *help*: if a help html-file for the current page/bean can be found, it will be shown. use the browsers back-button to return to the application.
* *refresh*: all configurations will be reloaded
* *exit*: stops the current user-session.

### Bean search and manipulation buttons

* *search*: searches for all beans of the current type and filter.
* *reset*: resets all search-filter fields and the result list
* *open*: opens all selected beans. only active, if on page-creation at least one selected items is available.
* *new*: creates a new item of the given type. default values found by configuration will set - navigation history values will be set, too. 
* *delete*: deletes all selected items.

### Bean detail buttons

* *save*: saves/persists the current bean.
* *close*: closes the current page, returning to the last one without saving.

### Buttons defined through actions inside the beans/entities itself

Each entity can define actions to be presented as buttons itself. See chapter _Bean Actions_.

### Administrating the Application

to control the application, it listens to commands on a connected session. The commands have to start with the instance-ID of the current NanoH5 instance. This is can be read from file *instance-id.txt* in the environments temp directory.

At the moment, the following commands are known:
* shutdown: does a system.exit(0)
* close: closes the current session
* back: goes back to the next working item

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8067/3217712234-shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Dependencies

While the _tsl2.nano_ framework has only a static dependency to simple-xml, using datbase-connections, bean or ddl generation will result in additional dependencies to other libraries. It's easy to add these libraries putting them into the environment path - they will be load on runtime, too. If you have a network connection, the _tsl2.nano_ framework tries to resolve the dependencies for you.

#### The Jar-Resolver

The _JarResolver_ is able to resolve dependencies on runtime through a network connection using maven. It knows some important classes (driver, persistence-provider etc.) and their depending jar-files.

*Features*

* installs maven by itself (through a network connection)
* transforms known class names (with package) to known jar-dependencies
* creates dynamically a pom.xml holding all dependencies
* loads all given dependencies through maven to the current path

You can switch off using jar-resolving throuth the NetworkClassloader by setting the java-argument *tsl2nano.offline=true*. Or you set the ENV property *classloader.usenetwork.loader = false*.

#### Framework dependencies

Static Dependencies (direct referenced by tsl2.nano):

* simple-xml-2.7.jar

##### Dynamic Dependencies (used by tsl2.nano, but through compatibility-layer)

* XmlUtil: velocity-1.6-dep.jar 
* CommonTest: junit-4.8.2.jar 
* AntUtil: ant-launcher.jar, ant.jar, ant-nodeps.jar 
* BeanEnhancer: javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar

##### No Dependencies, but useful to do the work

* jdbc database driver (like hsqldb.jar)
* jpa o/r mapper (like hibernate, toplink, eclipselink, openjpa, datanucleus, batoo-jpa, ormlite or ebean)
* generator tool to create entity beans (like hibernate-tools or openjpa)

Hibernate 4 for example would have the following dependencies:

* commons-collections-3.2.1.jar 
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar 
* commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar 
* commons-io-1.3.2.jar 
* commons-lang-2.4.jar 
* commons-codec-1.6.jar 
* dom4j-1.6.1.jar 
* javassist-3.12.0.GA.jar
* antlr.jar
 
## Runtime Configuration

### Going Online - The Production Configuration

To go online, set the following environment variables:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	app.login.secure=true
	app.login.administration=false
	app.login.save.persistence=false
	app.mode.script=false
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

migrating to another server or system, please review the following properties:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   service.url=SERVER:PORT
   app.update.last=DATE_NOTIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mirgrating from linux to windows and vice versa:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ...change the database script runServer.cmd: -cp h2* to -cp *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## The Administration Panel

The administration panel contains buttons for:

* The Scripttool - to create own queries/statistics on runtime
* Reset the runtime to reload all configuration files
* Switching between normal- and debug-logging
* Shutdown - to stop the entire application - and if started the integrated local database (hsqldb) creating a database backup in the environments _temp_ directory.

## Extensions of a BeanDefinition  / Presentation

The _Extension_ is a workaround for de-/serializings through _simple-xml_. While you must know the type of your deserializing root element,
it is not possible, to load any class-extensions.

This class can be used as member of your base-class. after deserializing you can create the desired extension
instance through informations of this extension-instance.
<p/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USE:

- mark all extending members with annotation {@link Transient} (not with javas keyword 'transient')
- on serialization of your extension class, call {@link #Extension(Object)} in your method annotated with {@link Commit}.
    {AT}Persist
    protected void initSerialization() {
        extension = new Extension(this);
        if (extension.isEmpty())
            extension = null;
    }
- on de-serialization, call {@link #to(Object)} getting the desired instance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
## Plugins inside a BeanDefinition or AttributeDefinition

Plugins can be added to the beandefinition or an attribute-definition. A plugin must implement the interface _IConnector_ with its method _connect(connectionEnd)_. This method will be called after deserialization - so you can do anything with all properties of a bean instance.

Your plugin implementation must provide the following:
* implementation of IConnector
* serializable
* must have a default constructor

Example with plugin implementation 'RuleCover':

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<attributeDefinition ...>
...
   <plugin class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.RuleCover">
		<rule for-property="constraint.nullable" name="specification-rule-name" />
   </plugin>
</attributeDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example for programmatically adding plugins:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	myattribute.addPlugin(myPlugin);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Specifying Rules, Queries and Actions to be used on Beans and Attributes

To do a structured work on a usable specification, rules, queries and actions can be defined before implementing or configuring the presentation. This is done by creating these items as xml-files inside the environments _specifiation_ directory. To see how it works, hit the applications menu button 'sample-codes' and have a look into the specification directory.

All items in the specification directory will be tested against their own _specification_ entries. These are assertions for simple test or boundary conditions. The tests/checks are done on creating the instances of the rules. To switch these tests off, set the environment variable _"rule.check.specifications"_ to false.

### The __ActionScript__ and __RuleScript__ can interpret the following script languages:

* Javascript(default, included as nashorn)
* Groovy	(maven: org.codehaus.groovy=groovy-all)
* Python	(maven: org.python=jython)
* Scala		(org.scala-lang=scala-library)
* JRuby		(org.jruby=jruby-complete)
* Rhino		(org.mozilla=rhino)
* Closure	(org.clojure=clojure)
* BeanShell	(org.beanshell=bsh)
* Ceylon	(org.ceylon-lang=ceylon.language)
* Golo		(org.golo-lang=golo)

to use a jvm script language (other than the internal javascript) you have to add the attribute 'language' to your action or rule in the root tag:

Example:
	<ruleScript name="calcTime" language="python">
 
	<actionScript name="calcTime" language="groovy">
	
nano.h5 will try to download and add the script libraries to the classpath.

### Example for a query

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<query name="personen" nativeQuery="false">
   <query><![CDATA[select p from Person p]]></query>
</query>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Example for an action, starting an ant-script

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<action name="ant" declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.execution.ScriptUtil">
   <parameter name="arg1">
      <type javaType="java.lang.String"/>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="arg2">
      <type javaType="java.lang.String"/>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="arg3">
      <type javaType="java.util.Properties"/>
   </parameter>
   <constraint name="arg2">
      <definition type="java.lang.String" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <defaultValue class="java.lang.String">help</defaultValue>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <constraint name="arg1">
      <definition type="java.lang.String" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <defaultValue class="java.lang.String">C:\eigen\tsl2\tsl2-workspace\tsl2-nano\target\test.h5.sample\h5.sample/antscripts.xml</defaultValue>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <operation>ant</operation>
</action>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action can be referenced in your presentation beandef:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<beanDefinition ...>
...
      <action class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.SpecifiedAction" name="ant" />
</beanDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action will be shown as button in your beansdefs detail view.

### The rule cover

The rule cover is a plugin-mechanism to override fix values of beandefinition properties through dynamic evaluation of referenced specification rules.
 
Example, referencing a rule for a property of your beandefinition:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<beanDefinition ...>
...
   <plugin class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.RuleCover">
		<rule for-property="constraint.nullable" name="specification-rule-name" />
   </plugin>
</beanDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three rule types are known:
- *Rule*: a boolean/numeric operation
- *RuleScript*: a java script expression
- *RuleDecisionTable*: a decision table where the first column defines the parameter names and all following column are decision values. the last line defines the result vector.

### Defining a rule through javascript

Use a _RuleScript_ to define a rule with a javascript expression.
 
Example returning a map with an html style to be used as layoutconstraint on an attribute:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
String redColorStyle = "color: red;";
String greenColorStyle = "color: green;";

//define the rule
RuleScript<String> presValueColor =
    new RuleScript<String>(
        "presValueColor", "var map = new java.util.HashMap(); map.put('style', value > 10 ? '" 
        + redColorStyle
        + "' : '" + greenColorStyle + "'); map;", null);

//this will persist the rule to '<ENV>/specification/rule/presValueColor.xml'            
ENV.get(RulePool.class).add(presValueColor);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...the xml equivalent would be:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ruleScript name="presValueColor">
   <operation>var map = new java.util.HashMap(); map.put(&apos;style&apos;, value &gt; 10 ? &apos;color: red;&apos; : &apos;color: green;&apos;); map;</operation>
</ruleScript>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...the rule-cover could be done with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RuleCover.cover(Charge.class, ATTR_VALUE, "presentable.layoutConstraints", "%" + presValueColor.getName());
RuleCover.cover(Charge.class, ATTR_VALUE, "columnDefinition.presentable.layoutConstraints", "%" + presValueColor.getName());

charge.saveDefinition();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Defining a rule through a decision table

Use a _RuleDecisionTable_ to define a rule through an excel sheet exporting its data through an *csv* file.

Example creating a csv and referencing this csv through a RuleDecisionTable:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
String redColorStyle = "color: red;";
String greenColorStyle = "color: green;";

//create a csv file holding a decision-table
TableList tl = new TableList<>(2);
tl.add("matrix", "<1>", "<2>", "<3>", "<4>", "<5>", "<6>", "<7>");
tl.add("weekday", "Mo", "Di", "Mi", "Do", "Fr","Sa", "So");
tl.add("result", greenColorStyle, greenColorStyle, greenColorStyle, greenColorStyle, greenColorStyle, redColorStyle, redColorStyle);
String ruleDir = ENV.get(RulePool.class).getDirectory();
FileUtil.save(ruleDir + "weekcolor.csv", tl.dump());

//now, we create the rule referencing the weekcolor.csv decision-table:
RuleDecisionTable dtRule = RuleDecisionTable.fromCSV(ruleDir + "weekcolor.csv");
ENV.get(RulePool.class).add(dtRule);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...the xml equivalent would be:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ruleDecisionTable name="weekcolor">
   <operation>[BASEDIR]/.nanoh5.timesheet/specification/rule/weekcolor.csv</operation>
</ruleDecisionTable>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...the csv would be:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
matrix	<1>	<2>	<3>	<4>	<5>	<6>	<7>	
weekday	Mo	Di	Mi	Do	Fr	Sa	So	
result	color: green;	color: green;	color: green;	color: green;	color: green;	color: red;	color: red;	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...the rule-cover could be done with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RuleCover.cover(Charge.class, ATTR_FROMDATE, "presentable.layoutConstraints", "&" + dtRule.getName());
RuleCover.cover(Charge.class, ATTR_FROMDATE, "columnDefinition.presentable.layoutConstraints", "&" + dtRule.getName());

charge.saveDefinition();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Defining an action through javascript

Use a _ActionScript_ to define an action with a javascript expression.
 
Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Defining a rule through standard java operations

Use a _Rule_ to define an action with an expression containing standard java operations.
 
Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## The _ScriptTool_

After login, you are able to execute queries and scripts like ant-scripts. You have to enable it in your _environment.xml_ to see the _ScriptTool_ in the list of _BeanCollectors_.

With _ScriptTool_ you can define and save queries which will be loaded on next start time as virtual beandefinition - means, it is inside the bean-type list.
 
## Layout and Styling

### Using CSS

Html styles can be added through import of css files. On building each html page, the file *meta-frame.html* will be searched inside the environments *css* directory: _css/meta-frame.html_.
The _meta-frame.html_ defines the html header and an empty body. Inside the header you should define the css style files you want to be used. The style files must define a class *menu* through the tags *ul* and *li*. Then, each page will have a menu at the top - instead of a button panel.

An example is provided with _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_. After first start, a css directory will be created. To turn on the given css-styling, rename the file _meta-framex.html_ to _meta-frame.html_ This is only an example - not yet working perfectly!

### Editing the layout through environment properties on runtime

The layout of the main panels are pre-defined through environment properties. The environment properties are changeable on runtime through the administration panel - only enabled through the main panel that comes directly after the login.

* hit the button 'Administration' on the top
* click on the button on the left side of the property field

now, you see a list of all available environment properties.

The following entries define panel layouts through css styles or html5 attributes:

* app.page.style	background-image: url(icons/stadion.jpg)
* layout.attribute.label.color	#FFFFFF
* layout.attribute.label.width	250
* layout.button.width	-1
* layout.configurator.grid.style	background-image: url(icons/art029.jpg); color: white; background: transparent
* layout.constraints.default
* layout.default
* layout.footer.grid.style	background-image: url(icons/spe.jpg)
* layout.grid.row1.style	background-color: #CCCCFF;background: transparent
* layout.grid.row2.style	background: transparent
* layout.grid.show.caption	false
* layout.grid.style	background: transparent; border: 10; color: #FFFFFF
* layout.header.button.text.show	true
* layout.header.grid.style	background-image: url(icons/spe.jpg); background: transparent
* layout.header.menu.open	false
* layout.page.data.fullwidth	false
* layout.page.data.style	overflow: auto; height: 70%;
* layout.page.navigation.section.style	color: #AAAAAA;
* layout.panel.columncount	9
* layout.panel.maxrowcount	25
* layout.panel.style
* layout.sidenav false

this will look like:

[[img src=h5.sample.layout.jpg]]
	
### Configuring Presentation, Layout and Constraints

Layouts and LayoutConstraints must be of type *Map* or *String*. If a string is given, this string will be set as element style.

Note: to add some help or informations for an entity or the application, you can put html files to the environment directory 'doc/'. If the application name is 'anyway', the help document will be searched in 'doc/anyway/entities/index.html'. If there is an entitiy of name 'Address', the help document will be searched in 'doc/entities/address.html'. To change these paths - perhaps to link to an url, change the dependent entry inside the environment.xml (e.g.: doc.url.address=http://anyurl.any)

#### Overview styles for Application, BeanCollectors and Beans

The environment properties provide a fast way to define the applications page style. Change the entry _application.page.style_ to use a custom background - perhaps a picture or a color. This must be an html5 css style expression.

The environment keys follow the structure *scope.description-path.field-or-action*:

scopes are:
* application: application definitions
* page: single page defintions
* beandef: generic bean-definition
* bean: bean instance definition
* collector: bean-collector definition
* beanconfigurator: bean-configurator definition

common description pathes are:

* use: boolean switch
* html: http/html definition
* layout: layout definition
* header: html-tag header definition
* footer: html-tag footer definition
* websocket: definition for dynamic web content over websocket
* field: any field/attribute definition
* default: any default value
* value: any value definition

Example setting a radial gradient background color:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <property name="application.page.style">
      <object class="java.lang.String">background: radial-gradient(#9999FF, #000000);</object>
   </property>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example setting a simple background image:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <property name="application.page.style">
      <object class="java.lang.String">background-image: url(icons/spe.jpg); background: transparent;</object>
   </property>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same can be done for a bean-collector, defining the property _beancollector.grid.style_ and for bean-details with _bean.grid.style_.

*Tip:* Use [CSS3Generator](css3generator.com) to prepare your css styles.

#### The Menu, the Actions and their Buttons

If you set *layout.sidenav* to *true*, all actions and their buttons will be positioned into a scrolling side navigation bar. This makes sense on small displays. On standard desktop-displays you should prefere the standard action bars.

[[img src=h5.sidenav-1.png]]

[[img src=h5.sidenav-2.png]]

#### Collectors, Beans and Attributes

Each bean and each bean-attribute can define a layout and layout-constraints through it's presentable object (see class _IPresentable_). It is easy to do layout definitions programmatically through the _BeanPresentationHelper_, but in this chapter we describe only the xml configuration. Help on programmatical configurations, see chapter _Programmatical configuration_. Inside the application (on runtime), there is a _BeanConfigurator_ providing to edit your _BeanDefinition_s as administrator. 

Setting the layout for beans or attributes may often be done through setting their styles. Be carefull with this, while this overwrite framework-styles. The best way is, to have a look at the html source to see, which style was set before.

TODO describe

### Bean-Collector Presentation

A bean-collector shows a set of bean-instances. The collector is defined by a bean-type or directly by a collection of items. The bit-field _mode_ defines, which actions can be done on a bean-collector.

Mode:
* _Searchable_: a search and reset action can be done on that bean-collector
* _Filter_: a table filter will be provided
* _Editable_: an open action is available
* _Creatable_: new and delete actions are available
* _Assignable_: an assign action can assign the current selection to the previous edited bean.

If an item was selected and opened, this item (a _Bean_) will be presented as detail in a new page.

#### letting the beancollector start the search action on activation

Normally a bean collector provides a search mask to filled and started through user input. If only a small number of items are available in the database, it will be loaded directyl, depending on the environments entry *beancollector.do.search.on.count.lowerthan* with a default of 20.

If you want to have a pre-filled collection, you have to define at least one _minsearch_ or _maxsearch value inside the bean definitions column definitions.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 <columnDefinition name="value" columnIndex="9" sortIndex="-1" isSortUpDirection="true" width="-1">
	<minsearch class="java.lang.Integer">2</minsearch>
	<maxsearch class="java.lang.Integer">8</maxsearch>
...
 </columnDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course you have to use values that are compatible with the attributes type.

You are able to predefine/memorize beans to be used on new beans or to constrain the search attributes. Go into the detail page of a bean and click 'memorize' at the top menu to store that bean inside your current session as default bean of that type.

#### Grouping list of data in expandable panels

Sometimes you need to group your data in expandable blocks. This can be done through the presentable instance providing a _groupby_ property.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	<beanDefinition clazz="org.anonymous.project.Request" name="Request" isNested="false" isdefault="false" xmlns="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano ./beandef.xsd">
	   <presentable class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.Html5Presentable" type="0" style="0" visible="true" searchable="true" nesting="false">
	      <label>Request</label>
	      <description>Request</description>
		  <groupby title="test" attribute="name" having=".*test.*" expanded="true" />
	   </presentable>
	   ...
	</beanDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _title_ is the title of the expandable panel and _attribute_ is the name of an attribute defined inside this beandefinition.
The _having_ property is a regular expression that given attributes value has to match to be grouped inside this group-by.

In the example above all rows are grouped into the expandable "test" where the attribute _name_ contains the string "test".

Most Browsers will build unexpected results, so this feature is disabled on default. To activate it, please set the environment property

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	collector.ignore.groupby.expandables = true
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
#### Creating a detailed summary for a bean collector

Example using the standard summary function of the bean collector on numbers:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<columnDefinition standardSummary="true">
...
</columnDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example using the query _sumvalue_ defined in specification:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<columnDefinition>
...
	<summary class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.expression.SQLExpression">
		<expression><![CDATA[�sumvalue]]></expression>
	</summary>
...
</columnDefinition>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where the _sumvalue_ expression is defined inside the specifications with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<query name="sumvalue" nativeQuery="false">
   <query><![CDATA[select sum(value) as Gesamt from Charge where party.name = '${party.name}' ]]></query>
</query>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

the variable _party.name_ must be defined by the user before while selecting (see action _memorize_) a party to use.

#### direct queries through _QueryResult_

To define direct sql or jpa-ql queries beside the standard mechanism though compiled beans you have the possibility to show a list of values direct through _QueryResult_ which is an extension of _BeanCollector_.
_QueryResult_s can be defined through the _ScriptTool_. There you can test your queries and save it as _QueryResult_. The _QueryResult_ will be loaded into the list of available bean-collector on next application start.
 
Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<queryResult clazz="java.lang.Object" name="virtual.times-overview" isNested="false" isdefault="true" xmlns="beandef.xsd">
   <extension declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.h5.collector.QueryResult">
      <member name="queryName">
         <object class="java.lang.String">times-overview</object>
      </member>
   </extension>
</queryResult>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples queryName _times-overview_ has to exist in directory _specification/query_.
 
#### direct controlling a set of beans through the _Controller_

The _Controller_ is an extension of _BeanCollector_ to present a collection of beans through their actions. These actions should be simple change-actions for attributes - like de- or increasing their values. This feature should be used for touch-screen applications.

To provide such a controller you can create an xml-file inside your environments _beandef/virtual_ directory. All beandefs inside the _virtual_ directory will be added to the bean-type list which is presented after login.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<controller clazz="org.anonymous.project.Times" name="virtual.time-actions-controller" isNested="false" isdefault="true" xmlns="beandef.xsd">
   <extension declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.h5.collector.Controller">
      <member name="beanName">
         <object class="java.lang.String">time-actions</object>
      </member>
   </extension>
</controller>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### direct creating a set of beans through the _Compositor_

The _Compositor_ is an extension of _BeanCollector_ to present a panel of actions to create beans through dependent beans. These actions will be build on runtime, reading its informations from database. This feature should be used for touch-screen applications.

To provide such a controller you can create an xml-file inside your environments _beandef/virtual_ directory. All beandefs inside the _virtual_ directory will be added to the bean-type list which is presented after login.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<compositor clazz="org.anonymous.project.Charge" name="Compositor (Item-Charge)" isNested="false" isdefault="false" xmlns="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano ./beandef.xsd">
   <presentable class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.Html5Presentable" type="0" style="0" visible="true" searchable="true" nesting="false">
      <label>Charge</label>
      <description>Charge</description>
      <icon>icons/properties.png</icon>
   </presentable>
   <valueExpression expression="{chargeitem} ({fromdate}: {value})" type="org.anonymous.project.Charge"/>
   <isconnected>false</isconnected>
   <extension declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.h5.collector.Compositor">
      <member name="workingMode">
         <object class="java.lang.Integer">16</object>
      </member>
      <member name="reloadBean">
         <object class="java.lang.Boolean">true</object>
      </member>
      <member name="parentType">
         <object class="java.lang.Class">org.anonymous.project.Item</object>
      </member>
      <member name="baseAttribute">
         <object class="java.lang.String">chargeitems</object>
      </member>
      <member name="targetAttribute">
         <object class="java.lang.String">chargeitem</object>
      </member>
      <member name="iconAttribute">
         <object class="java.lang.String">icon</object>
      </member>
      <member name="forceUserInteraction">
         <object class="java.lang.Boolean">true</object>
      </member>
   </extension>
...attribute definitions like for the standard BeanDefinition of 'Charge' ...
</compositor>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

using the nano.common bean framework api you would code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bean<BeanConfigurator<Charge>> bconf = BeanConfigurator.create(Charge.class);
bconf.getInstance().actionCreateCompositor(Item.class.getName(), "chargeitems", "chargeitem", "icon");
GenericLocalBeanContainer.initLocalContainer(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), false);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example (from timesheet package), you have the model with a manyToMany resolver:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Item (*) --> (1) ChargeItem (1) --> (*) Charge 

	==>
	
	[Item.class.getName() --> Item.chargeItems --> Charge.chargeItem]

	base type             : Item
	base attribute name   : chargeitems 
	target attribute name : chargeitem
	icon attribute name   : icon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entities have the following access methods:
* Item.chargeItems (java.util.Set<ChargeItem>)
* Charge.chargeItem (ChargeItem)

The icon is an optional reference to an attribute holding an image to be presented on the button.

The simpliest way to create such a _Compositor_ is to use the BeanConfigurator of your current open detail bean:

[[img src=h5.sample.config.compositor.png]]

[[img src=h5.sample.config.compositor.detail.png]]

If you put in the desired variables and click again 'Create Compositor' this compositor will be saved as virtual definition to be presented in the list of beans on the next start.

##### Using the Compositor

The _Compositor_ creates new beans using a pre-selection as default values. The pre-selection is done through the first line of the search panel - the _from_-Filter. All entries in the from-Filter are used as default values for new beans!

There is a flag (see the xml-file) _forceUserInteraction_ to define, whether the user sees the new bean and has to manual click the save-button - or if the system saves the new beans directly. This enables one-Click creation of new beans.

[[img src=h5.sample.compositor.png]]

All buttons marked with a questionmark (the default icon) are compositor actions defined on runtime through evaluation of entries of type _Item_ (in this example) of the current database.

#### Creating a CSheet like an Excel-Sheet

The CSheet is a bean that can be created through bean-configuration, giving a name, column-count and row-count. If an entry of a cell starts with '=', a calculation will be done.
The LogicTable as base class will dump its output to a file [name].csv in the specification directory.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  CSheet cSheet = new CSheet("test", 3, 3);
  cSheet.set(0, 1, 2, 3);
  cSheet.set(1, 4, 5, "=A2*B2");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will create a 3x3 table with one formula:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--	A	B	C	
1	1	2	3	
2	4	5	=A2+B2	
3	null	null	null	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a cell starts with '=', it will be calculated and replaced by the result. The calculation may contain any specified formula: rules, rule-scripts, sql-statements and actions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--	A	B	C	
1	1	2	3	
2	4	5	=my_select(A1, A2)	
3	null	null	<<my_update(A1, A2)>>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a cell is bound into '<<' and '>>', the formula/action will be calculated without replacing the cell content with the result.

### Bean Presentation

A bean - as container of it's attributes - will always be presented as detail page. 

[[img src=h5.sample.entity.jpg]]

A detail page presents the attributes of a bean as it is defined in it's bean-definition xml file. for more informations see chapter _Configuration through Serialization_.

#### Value Expressions

Each bean and attribute can be presented by and created by a text expression. On beans, this expression (called _ValueExpression_) should contain at least one bean-attribute (perhaps the id, but if another attribute is more readable but unique, you would prefer this). These _ValueExpression_ will be used to present a bean in a list, or if it is used as relation in another bean. The creation through a string works only, if the bean provides a default-constructor and the attributes in the expression have setter-methods.

Two kinds of expressions are possible:

##### Standard _java.text.MessageFormat_ expression

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{forename}, {name}, {birthday}/{birthcity}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

##### C-like _printf_ expression

TODO: explain

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%birthday$TD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Value Groups and Sub-Panels

Optional a bean-definition can define value groups - a list of attributes - to be presented in its own panel.

#### Multiple Value Relations

Whether multiple value relations (one-to-many) are shown is defined inside the environments filter _default.present.attribute.multivalue_. The bean name must match the regex-filter.

### Attribute Presentation

The attributes are the most important and complex definitions. They contain sub-definitions described in the next chapter. Each attribute will be presented by a label, defined by the _Presentable.getLabel()_ the value itself, mostly shown as input field and optional, if the value has a relation to other beans or is a collection of values - a selection button. The label will be translated through a resource bundle - the message.properties. It is possible to embed html-tags inside the translation.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
persistence.connectionUrl=<a href="http://www.databasedrivers.com/jdbc/">Database-URL</a>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a standard filter to present only non-technical single value fields. So, the following types of attributes will not be shown on default:
 - multiple values (like collections)
 - id fields (mostly filled by generic sequences)
 - timestamps (filled automatically by system; use DATE and TIME for user inputs)
 
The _BeanPresentationHelper.isDefaultAttribute(IAttribute attribute)_ implements that filter and can be switched off by setting the environment variable _bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter_ to _false_. Or you can set switches for the three types directly:
 - default.present.attribute.id: regular expression - e.g.: .*
 - default.present.attribute.multivalue: regular expression - e.g.: .*
 - default.present.attribute.timestamp: regular expression - e.g.: .*

Be careful, jpa generators like hibernate may change their implementation on generated temporal types from DATE to TIMESTAMP.

#### Dynamic Attribute Presentation

The presentation of an attribute can be defined through an xml file. To use dynamic presentation values, you can use the plugin _RuleCover_ which will invoke the given rule for a defined property.

#### Attribute Declaration

This is the most important attribute property. Normally it is a standard bean-attribute, defined by the declaring class and the attribute name. The following declaration types are available:

* bean-attribute: (default, _de.tsl2.nano.core.cls.BeanAttribute_) the attribute value is defined by the declaring class and the attribute name (accessed through getter and setter methods)
* virtual-attribute: the attribute value is any fixed value
* value-expression: the attribute value is defined by an expression
	* path-expression: the expression is a path from a bean-attribute to another one - through one or more relations. expression example: _person.organization.name_.
	* rule-expression: the expression is an existing rule name.
	* sql-expression: the expression is an existing query name.
	* url-expression: the expression is the url of a restful-service
	* simple-expression: any expression with ant-like variables

All available attribute instances:

Example for an attribute through a relation path:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <attribute name="path-test">
      <attributeDefinition id="false" unique="false" composition="false" cascading="false" generatedValue="false">
         <declaring class="de.tsl2.nano.bean.def.PathExpression" declaringClass="org.anonymous.project.Times" type="java.lang.Object">
            <expression><![CDATA[id.dbBegin]]></expression>
         </declaring>
         <constraint type="java.lang.Object" nullable="true" length="-1">
            <scale>-1</scale>
            <precision>-1</precision>
         </constraint>
         <description>path-test</description>
         <presentable class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.Html5Presentable" type="2" style="4" visible="true" searchable="true">
            <label>DbBegin</label>
            <description>DbBegin</description>
            <enabler class="de.tsl2.nano.action.IActivable$2" active="false"/>
         </presentable>
         <doValidation>true</doValidation>

if a relation is an iterable or map, it can be specified through a parameter.

Examples for one-to-many relation paths:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. customer.address[first].city
2. customer.address[0].city
3. customer.address.city     (the first address, too)
4. customer.address[last].street
5. customer.address[-1].code (the last address)
6. customer.address[street=berlinerstrasse].city

#### Constraints

The attribute constraint defines the

* _type_: attributes java type
* _nullable_: if the attributes value may be null (empty)
* _format_: an attributes value has to match the formats expression to be valid
* _length_: maximum length of input characters to be valid
* _scale, precision_: scale and precision if attribute is of type number
* _min, max, allowedValues_: the attributes value range. you may define a min and max range - or only a list of allowd values.

#### Presentable

These are generalized properties to define the presentation in any gui (graphical user interface, surface):

* _type, style_: bit-field to define a gui specific user-input
* _visible_: whether to show the attribute
* _label_: a label for the attributes input field
* _description_: an attribute description to be used f.e. as tooltip or title
* _layout_: in nano.h5: a map of html5 attributes to be set for child elements, if attribute is a container
* _layoutconstraints_: in nano.h5: a map of html5 attributes to be set for the attributes html element
* _icon_: optional icon to be shown with that attribute

*Presentable types and styles:*

*Data and attachments*

The following types declare data types that should be editable through the attachment type:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TYPE_ATTACHMENT		= 256
TYPE_DATA			= 8192
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have a file selector box as user input, you should use TYPE_ATTACHMENT.
To define the detailed style of your data, you can set one of the following styles:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STYLE_DATA_IMG		= 128
STYLE_DATA_EMBED	= 256
STYLE_DATA_OBJECT	= 512
STYLE_DATA_CANVAS	= 1024
STYLE_DATA_AUDIO	= 2048
STYLE_DATA_VIDEO	= 4096
STYLE_DATA_DEVICE	= 8192
STYLE_DATA_FRAME	= 16384
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These styles correspond to the equal named html5 tag names. The default style is *img*, where no additional informations are required. If you use the style *object*, you have to define the *mimetype* for the object. You do this through a layout property (e.g. type="image/svg+xml").

Using the type *TYPE_ATTACHMENT* and style *STYLE_DATA_OBJECT* would result in the html-tag

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<object data="myfile.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example, showing an svg as attachment:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <attribute name="icon">
      <attributeDefinition id="false" unique="false" composition="false" cascading="false" generatedValue="false">
         <declaring class="de.tsl2.nano.core.cls.BeanAttribute" declaringClass="org.anonymous.project.Item" name="icon"/>

Using the style _embed_ would embed the whole attachment content into the html response file - only, if no _pluginspage_ attribute was defined. all other styles only reference the given source file with an _src_ attribute.

To show for example a pdf file in your html page, you can add a plugin attribute. Add the following layout tag to the attributes presentable tag.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	<layout name="pluginspage">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</layout>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please have a look at the html5-tags and their corresponding attributes, that could be provided through the attributes layout definition map.

#### Column-Definitions

The column-definitions describe the beans presentation in bean-table with columns - as the bean-collector do.

* _width_: column width
* _columnIndex_: at which position this column is shown (number between 0 and bean-attribute-count
* _sortIndex_: sort position, if multiple sort conditions are supported
* _isSortUpDirection_: if true, the sorting direction is _up_, otherwise _down_
* _presentable_: presentable properties like them in the attribute-constraints

#### Rule-Attributes

Rule attributes are virtual attributes showing the result of a specified rule.

##### Showing calculated values through integrated rule engine

The integrated rule engine provides calculations of rules - optional calling sub-rules - having one or more input parameter and a result value after execution. Input parameter can be constraint through java-types and value-ranges.

A rule calculates a combination of mathematical and conditioning expressions.

Example: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A1 & A2 ? ((x1 + x2) * $myrule2) : 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where A1, A2 are boolean values and x1, x2 numbers and myrule2 another referenced (using '�') rule.

Example xml-file for a rule:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<rule name="test">
   <parameter name="A">
      <type>BOOLEAN</type>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="x1">
      <type>NUMBER</type>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="x2">
      <type>NUMBER</type>
   </parameter>
   <constraint name="result">
      <definition type="java.math.BigDecimal" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <min class="java.math.BigDecimal">0</min>
         <max class="java.math.BigDecimal">10</max>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <constraint name="x1">
      <definition type="java.math.BigDecimal" nullable="true" length="-1">
         <min class="java.math.BigDecimal">0</min>
         <max class="java.math.BigDecimal">1</max>
         <scale>-1</scale>
         <precision>-1</precision>
      </definition>
   </constraint>
   <operation>A ? (x1 + 1) : (x2 * 2)</operation>
</rule>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example for a rule using another sub-rule:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<rule name="test-import">
   <parameter name="A">
      <type>BOOLEAN</type>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="x1">
      <type>NUMBER</type>
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="x2">
      <type>NUMBER</type>
   </parameter>
   <operation>A ? 1 + (A ? (x1 + 1) : (x2 * 2)) : �test</operation>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Presenting data or media like images, audio, video

If an attribute holds data of type _byte[]_, it may be presented as image or any other non-textual type. The default-mechanism will declare the attributes type as _TYPE_DATA_ which will save the attributes value to a temporary file to be sent through http to the client and to be shown as image - or if a special style was defined, as _embed_, _object_, _audio_, _video_, _canvas_ or _device_ - as known from _HTML5_ embedded content tags.

#### Interactive actions on images

Using pixel or vector pictures as attribute content and defining a dependency listener of type _WebSocketDependencyListener_ will give you the possibility to let the user interact on data content. your dependency listener will have access to the clients mouse click position to refresh other attributes depending on that click into the picture or vector graphic.

#### Attribute Encryption

Set the _secure_ property on your attribute - if it is of type String - to have an attribute encryption. The framework provides two implementations:
 
1. hashes: de.tsl2.nano.core.secure.Hash
2. crypt : de.tsl2.nano.core.secure.Crypt

If you use hash, the presentation will automatically be a password field. Setting a new value will directly hash the value.
If you use crypt, the en- decryption will be done on saving or loading the bean and its attributes.

### Bean Actions

Each entity can define methods that will automatically be presented as buttons on a detail panel. This methods must follow the following constraints:

1. the method must be public in any class inside the current class hierarchy.
2. the method name must start with prefix 'action' or must have the annotation @Action.

With Annotation _@Action_ you can define parameter names, if you have method parameters. Additionally you can define more parameter constraints through Annotation _@Column_.

Example without Annotation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public void actionRemoveRuleCover(String child, String rule) {
    RuleCover.removeCover(attr.getDeclaringClass(), attr.getName(), child);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example with Annotation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@de.tsl2.nano.bean.annotation.Action(name = "addListener", argNames = { "Observer Attribute",
    "Observable Attribute", "Rule-Name" })
public void actionAddListener(
        @Constraint(pattern = "(\\w+") String observer,
        @Constraint(pattern = "(\\w+") String observable,
        @Constraint(pattern = "[%�!]\\w+") String rule) {
    BeanDefinition def = ENV.get(BeanConfigurator.class).def;
    Html5Presentation helper = (Html5Presentation) def.getPresentationHelper();
    helper.addRuleListener(observer, rule, observable);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to add any action on runtime to your bean. 

- Simply go to configuration page of your bean (use page button 'configuration' if you are inside your beans detail page).
- use _Create specification Action_, if you didn't yet define the desired specification action and define a name and an existing class+method (mypackage.MyClass.myMethod).
- use _Add Action_ and write the specified action name in the next page

Example creating a new bean action on runtime:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New specified Actionname	: testaction
Action-Expression			: de.tsl2.nano.core.util.NetUtil.getRestfulJSON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...this will result in file _.../specification/action/testaction.xml_:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<action name="testaction" declaringClass="de.tsl2.nano.core.util.NetUtil">
   <parameter name="arg1">
      <type javaType="java.lang.String" />
   </parameter>
   <parameter name="arg2">
      <type javaType="[Ljava.lang.Object;"/>
   </parameter>
   <operation>getRestfulJSON</operation>
</action>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...now you can _Add Action_ _testaction_ to your bean.

After saving the bean configuration, the new action should be available. test it, activating the new Button _Testaction_ and fill the first argument with test REST-Service-URL: _http://headers.jsontest.com/_. After activating the button _TestAction_ again, the REST service will be called and the returned JSON structure will be shown an a new simple html table.

## Changing Layouts through the _BeanConfigurator_

The chapter before described the structure of all definitions. _Nano.H5_ provides an administration tool inside the application to do some configurations on runtime. If you are inside the detail-page of a bean, there is an action 'Configuration' on your headers button-group. If you activate it, you are inside a configuration mode, letting you change layout and styling of the current bean.

[[img src=beanconfigurator.png]]

The value-expression defines the presentation of the current bean-definition. Inside the brackets there are any characters + several attribute-names to be present a bean-value.
F.e., if you have a bean _Person_ with attributes _id_ and _name_, but want to show only the name of a person in a list, you define: _{name}_.

### Presentable

Inside the _Presentable_ configuration, you are able to change f.e. the layout of a bean. F.e. you can add a border through it's layout-constraints:

[TODO png]

which result in

[TODO png]

### Adding Change Listeners and Rule Covers

The BeanConfigurator provides the ability to add change listeners and rule covers on bean attributes.

#### Change Listener

A change listener will be defined through an observer attribute, an observable attribute and a rule, calculating a reaction for the observer attribute if the observable changes.

You start the configuration after entering the configuration panel selecting an attribute and clicking the button 'Add Rule Listener'. Then you define three names (case-sensitive!):

1. observer attribute name
2. observable attribute name
3. existing rule name (defined in specification directory)

Then you hit 'Add Rule Listener' to finish the action. Close the configuration panels until you reach the panel having a 'save' button. Hit the save button to save the new configuration. The changes will be loaded after restart or reset.

#### Rule Covers

A rule cover covers any property to evaluate the properties value on runtime. A rule cover will be defined through a member of an attribute and a rule name. direct members of an attribute are:

* constraint (having properties to constrain the user input)
* presentable (having properties to define the gui presentation)
* columnDefinition (having properties to define the presentation inside a table)

You start the configuration after entering the configuration panel selecting an attribute and clicking the button 'Add Rule Cover'. Then you define two names (case-sensitive!):

* property of attribute (any property in the attributes member hierarchy. e.g.: presentable.layoutConstraints)
* existing rule name (defined in specification directory)

Then you hit 'Add Rule Cover' to finish the action. Close the configuration panels until you reach the panel having a 'save' button. Hit the save button to save the new configuration. The changes will be loaded after restart or reset.

## Resolving _many-to-many_ constellations

Mostly many-to-many constellations will be solved through an additional table in the middle.

Bean1(*)-->(1)Middle(1)-->(*)Bean2

_Nano.H5_ recognizes this constellations and solves the bindings through an internal mechanism called _composition_. For further informations see implementation of class _Composition_ and _BeanCollector_.

### Resolving Compositions

_Nano.h5_ recognizes a _composition_ through the following jpa annotations of a bean attribute:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@OneToMany(...)
@JoinColumn(...nullable=false)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the relation is uni-directional, the child bean is not persistable by itself. _Nano.h5_ will present no _save_ button but an _assign_ button. So, changes will be persisted only on the parent bean.

## Working on a page using the Keyboard

The gui provides shortcuts/hotkeys for each button to activate. As html provides basic field tabbing (of course, that depends on your browser), it should be possible to work fast using your keyboard only. Each button/action shows its hotkey/shortcut through its tooltip. The tooltip is shown positioning your mouse (;-)) cursor on the element.

On entering a search-page, the _search_ button will have always the default-focus. If a search was done, the _open_ button will have the default-focus.

On entering a detail-page, the _save_ button, if existing, will have the default-focus.

### Actions and Buttons

Each action is able to define a shortcut (keystroke). if not set, the default will be evaluated through the actions name. If that name contains a '&', the following character will be used as shortcut - if no '&' is contained and no keystroke was defined, the first character of the name will be used. E.g., if the name/label is "Clo&se", you have to hit _ALT+s_ to activate this action.

### Tableheader Buttons

Each standard table of beans will provide a table-header with Buttons to do up/down sorting (on first activation, up-sorting will be done, on second activation, down-sorting). On these Buttons we can't use the algorithm above to avoid shortcut collisions. These buttons will have shortcuts depending on their indexes. So, the first table-header column will be activated through a hit to _ALT+1_.

### Providing Html Dialogs through WebSockets

The API provides showing/controlling html dialogs through websockets. These dialogs wait for user interaction, blocking the current thread for given maximum time.

There are several possibilities to create the html document to show as dialog:

* directly through a html string : be sure to add the right answer buttons for that!
* giving a simple primitve object like a boolean : a yes/no dialog will be shown
* giving a complex bean object with bean attributes : the WSDialog will convert that automatically to a dialog 
* using WSDialog : it provides a simple logic to add title, fields and buttons

A dialog will be created through a call:

giving an html dialog string directly as message:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   import de.tsl2.nano.core.exception.Message;
   ...
   T response = Message.sendAndWaitForResponse(String message, Class<T> responseType);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or giving a simple or complex object, that will be converted to a dialog by WSDialog:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   T response = Message.ask(String title, T instance);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The response has to be of the same type as the instance.

#### Examples to create a dialog

##### Simple object of type boolean

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   T response = Message.ask("Do you want to Continue?", Boolean.TRUE);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the instance is used as default value and to evaluate the response type.

##### Complex bean, having getters/setters that will be presented as dialog inputs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   T response = Message.ask("Please fill all given fields!", myBean);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the instance is used as base and response. the bean attributes will be filled through
their names+setters. so the response will hold the bean with filled attributes.

##### using WSDialog to create the html dialog string

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   String dlg = new WSDialog("title", "message", 
      new WSButton("myTestButton")).
      addFields(new WSField("myTestField", "empty", MapUtil.asMap("type", "textarea"))).
      toWSDialog();

   String response = Message.sendAndWaitForResponse(dlg, inputText);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### technical info

While the *Message* class is owned by the *tsl2.nano.core module*, not knowing anything on dialogs,
it will call the ExceptionHandler of the current thread.

The *tsl2.nano.h5* module will set the WebSocketExceptinonHandler on all session threads, blocking the current session thread
unless the websocket worker returns a message to the NanoWebSocketServer. The NanoWebSocketServer will notify the
belonging session thread after providing the user input as response message.

##### creating own html dialog string

it is possible, to create the dialog string by yourself, but you have to provide an additional prefix '..mytitletext..@/dialog:'
(with ..mytitletext.. as your title text) and the buttons have to have the id 'wsdialog.button'. So be carefull ;-)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      String dlg = "My Dialog Title@/dialog:" +
         "<dialog id=\"wsdialog.formDialog\"><form method=\"dialog\"><h3>My Dialog Title</h3><p>message</p><div>my Test Field<input id=\"wsdialog.input.myTestField.id\" name=\"myTestField\" type=\"textarea\" value=\"empty\"/></div><button id=\"wsdialog.button\" name=\"myTestButton\" value=\"myTestButton\">my Test Button</button></form></dialog>";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Injecting own logic on the forms html DOM document

Implement the interface _IDOMExtender_ and provide the compiled class to the environment (copying the jar into the environment directory) to edit/change the default DOM tree. Here you can add additional informations and scripts to be sent to the client browser without knowing the tsl2.nano framework.
The Interface-method  _extend(Document doc, ISession<?> session)_ provides the full DOM-Document of the current response and the current session, holding all informations you need.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public class DOMExtender implements IDOMExtender {

    @Override
    public void extend(Document doc, ISession<?> session) {
        //TODO: create Testcase for that...
        Element node = doc.createElement("h1");
        node.setTextContent(this.getClass().getName());
        //the session provides all informations you need
        if (session instanceof NanoH5Session) {//on NanoH5 this is allways the case
            NanoH5Session h5Session = (NanoH5Session) session;
            Main app = h5Session.getApplication();

## Webstart with JNLP

_nano.h5_ provides a jnlp file on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano/files/1.1.0-beta/nano.h5.jnlp]. This webstart downloads the self-certificated *tsl2.nano.h5.<version>-signed.jar* to be started. On java 8, you have to add this download site to the exception list. Do the following steps:
* open the java control panel
* go to the security tab panel
* click 'edit site list'
* add the new site 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/tsl2nano/'. the ending slash is important to tell java to use that url as base url for all child pages.
* if you are debugging and are using a jnlp pointing to a local jar file, add the site 'file:///'
 
## Networking Modes

The _Nano.H5_ application can be started in different modes.

* *Standard Single Access Mode:*
	* environment property _http.ip_ is *localhost*. no other network node is able to connect to the application. useable as a simple client/server application.
* *Network Single Access Mode:*
	* environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using one environment and session. useable in an intranet to do some teamwork.
	* *Network Multiple Access Mode:*
	* environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session. may be used in an intranet.
	* *Network Multiple Security Mode:*
	* environment property _http.ip_ is a network ip of your system. all network nodes are able to connect to the application of your system, using their own environment and session working with ssl (under construction!). may be used in the internet.
	* environment property _app.ssl.activate_ is true, Nano.H5 provides a secure connection over https and wss.

## Authorization, Roles and Permissions

Permissions are set after connecting to the datasource through the persistence-unit. The permissions define activation of buttons and visiblity of fields. if all fields are invisible, no data and actions are available!

The application class _NanoH5_ has a method _createAuthorization()_ that defines a subject with a user-principal and it's roles, defined by permissions. If a file _[username]-permissions.xml_ is found, it will be used to fill the subject - if not, an admin-role with a wildcard-permission will permit anything!

Permissions contain a name - perhaps ended by a wildcard - and comma separated actions (a wildcard is possible, too. The permissions work on actions and data. The _BeanContainer_ provides to ask for permissions: call _BeanContainer.instance().hasPermission(name, actions) to check access to a call or to any data. The _Environment_ provides access to the implementation of _IAuthorization_. Call _Environment.get(IAuthorization.class).hasAccess(name, actions) to check for permissions.

To define special permissions for a user, change the content of the file _[username]-permissions.xml_ and use the translation resourcebundle _messages.properties_ to find the field and action names to fill in.
To use your own Authorization, set your implementation of IAuthorization as service in the environment.

The framework does all checks for you. But if you need extended access to authority informations, read the following details.

### Permissions on actions

To check whether a user can access a button (action) you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the id of the action. The second method parameter may be a wildcard (*) or _executable_.

Example configuration for the user SA with role admin:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<subject>
	   <principals class="java.util.Collections$SynchronizedSet">
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.UserPrincipal" name="SA" xmlns="permissions.xsd"/>
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.Role" name="admin">
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="*"/>
	      </principal>
	   </principals>
	   <readOnly>false</readOnly>
	</subject>

Example configuration for the user Test with role bet (in a bet game):

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<subject>
	   <principals class="java.util.Collections$SynchronizedSet">
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.UserPrincipal" name="mone" xmlns="permissions.xsd"/>
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.Role" name="bet">
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="bet.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="betliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="ranking.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="rankingliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="beancollectorliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="matchliste.search"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="matchliste.open"/>
	      </principal>
	   </principals>
	   <readOnly>false</readOnly>
	</subject>

Be sure to grant the user to the desired tables and views:

Example, creating a new user Test:

	CREATE USER Test PASSWORD 'test'
	GRANT ALL ON Bet TO Test
	GRANT SELECT ON Match TO Test
	GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA PUBLIC TO Test

### Permissions on data

To check whether an entity should be accessed by the current user, you call the _hasAccess_ of IAuthorization or _hasPermission_ of BeanContainer with the full-class-name[.]value-expression(data) representation of the current object. The second method parameter tells whether to read or/and write the object.
Means, if you have a class mypath.MyBean with attributes 'name', 'value' and you define a beans value-expression: {name}, you can constrain the data with:

	<basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="read" name0="mypath.MyClass.Sch.*"/>

this will list only data for beans having a name starting with 'Sch'.

Example configuration for a user seeing contents of Bet, Match, Tournament:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<subject>
	   <principals class="java.util.Collections$SynchronizedSet">
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.UserPrincipal" name="mone" xmlns="permissions.xsd"/>
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.Role" name="bet">
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="bet.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="betliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="ranking.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="rankingliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="beancollectorliste.*"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="matchliste.search"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="*" name0="matchliste.open"/>
	      </principal>
	      <principal class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.Role" name="view">
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="read,write" name0="org.anonymous.project.Bet"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="read" name0="org.anonymous.project.Match"/>
	         <basicPermission class="de.tsl2.nano.serviceaccess.aas.principal.APermission" actions="read" name0="org.anonymous.project.Tournament"/>

## Navigation and Workflows

A navigator will guide the user through his application session. Before/after each page, the navigator will evaluate the next bean to present. This may be list of entities or simply the details of an entity.

The application can work on a simple navigation stack - a simple implementation is provided by the *EntityBrowser*. If a configuration file *workflow.xml* is found inside your environment-path, this workflow will be used, to navigate the user through his application session.

### The EntityBrowser

The EntityBrowser works on a Navigation-Stack, putting all available entity-types to the first bean-collector to be able to browse through all beans and data.

### A configured Workflow

If a configured workflow is available, this workflow will be used as navigator. 
A workflow holds one or more activities defined by an enabling *condition* and an execution *expression*. After finishing a page, all activities will be checked for their entry/enabling condition. Only one *activity* should have a positive condition. This activity will be executed. The execution will be calling an EJB-QL given by the expression and returning the result of that query as next navigation bean.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<workflow name="test.workflow">
   <activity name="timesByProject">
      <condition>project&amp;true</condition>
      <expression>select t from Times t where t.project.id = :prjname</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>prjname</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
   <activity name="organisation">
      <condition>!organisation.activated</condition>
      <expression>select p from Organisation p where ? is null</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>prjname</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
   <activity name="person">
      <condition>organisation.activated &amp; (!person.activated)</condition>
      <expression>select p from Person p where p.organisation = ?</expression>
      <query-parameter length="1">
         <parameter>organisation</parameter>
      </query-parameter>
   </activity>
</workflow>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All parameters are stored and given by the workflow. The following parameters will be stored automatically:
* *response* = {last user action name}
* {activity-name}.size = count of entities found by your activity expression
* {activity-name} = if your activity expression found exactly one entity, this entitiy will be referenced here.
* {activity-name}.activated = true, if this activity was already activated

Use that parameters for your activity condition.

TODO: use bean-path to inspect condition expressions like 'times.type = F'.

## Database Replication - Working Offline

It is possible to replicate the data loaded from a remote database. The environments property _use.database.replication_ must be true (default is false!). The replication will be done through a second persistence-unit 'replication' (see _persistence.xml_). For each user an own local replication database will be created.

The replication is done in it's own thread to avoid conflictions with the application. The O/R mapper will create all tables through bean informations. A special bean holds the information (time, id, change-type) about the changes done by the user. All data, loaded and edited by the current user will be replicated to a local database. Of course the dependent data will be replicated, too, to have a valid datastore.

The replication connection is configurable like the persistence-unit is. But at the moment, only the combination hsqldb and hibernate are tested - and it's only usable in standalone-mode - without application-server!

The replications hsqldb database will be started internally (configuration :see META-INF/persistence.tml).
- database: replication-<user-name>
- port: 9898

If the model cycles entity relations, replication may fail. Sometimes, it helps to increase the heap memory (specially for the permormance) - if not, you should select other bean instance (base instances) before to replicate.

## Working on multiple Databases

In standalone mode, database connections are defined inside the _persistence.xml_. Define multiple _persistence_untit_s if you need access to multiple databases. Of course, they need their mapping entity beans. So define the beans jar file in the persistence.xml and store it in the environments directory.

Working inside an application server, the server will provide a database pool. connections are defined for example in jboss in a deployed xml file (or the jboss configuration file like standalone.xml) having datasource entries.

## Using an Applicationserver

If you don't want to have a standalone appliation, you are able to use an application server like jboss. To do this you must have:

* the *application servers client libraries* must be in your classpath. so copy them to your environment directory. with jboss eap 6.1 it would be _jboss-client.jar_.
* any entity beans and _remote interfaces_ of your ejb's should be in your classpath. so copy the jar holding them to your environment directory.
* of course, the *entity beans must be deployed* to that server perhaps in an ear or war-file.
* be sure to have *tsl2.nano.serviceaccess* packed into that ear/war-file. the service *IGenericService is essential.
* add environement property 'applicationserver.authentication.service' (default: __org.nano.[environment-name].service.remote.IUserService__) with service class name. 
* add environment property 'applicationserver.authentication.method' (default: __login__) with service method to call. this method has to have two string-parameters for user and password. the method has to call _ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(userObject, mandatorObject, subject, userRoles, features, featureInterfacePrefix)_
* on the login page input user and password
* create a *jndi.properties* file in your environment. with jboss this would look like the following:

### Example jndi for jboss eap 6.1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	java.naming.factory.initial=org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory
	java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.ejb.client.naming
	java.naming.provider.url=remote://localhost:4447
	java.naming.security.principal=<jndi-prefix>
	java.naming.security.credentials=<perhaps the application name>
	jboss.naming.client.ejb.context=true
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Example authentication service method

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UserService.authenticate(String user, String password) {
...
    //fill the server side ServiceFactory
    if (!ServiceFactory.isInitialized()) {
        ServiceFactory.createInstance(this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        //registriere shared und error messages
        ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproject.shared_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
        bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("org.mycompany.myproduct.error_messages",
            Locale.getDefault(),
            this.getClass().getClassLoader());
        Messages.registerBundle(bundle, false);
    }
    
    /*
     * a user session will be created on server side.
     */
    final Collection<String> userRoles = new LinkedList<String>();
    final Collection<String> mandatorFeatures = getMandatorFeatures();
    ServiceFactory.instance().createSession(null, getMandant(), null, userRoles, mandatorFeatures, null);
...
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Generating your Entities

It is possible to generate your entity beans through a tool like hibernate-tools or openjpa. This is prepared in _Nano.H5_, for further informations see chapter _Model Driven Architecture (MDA))_.

If hibernate-tools creates your beans, it may create additional beans to use composed primary keys. To use them with _nano.h5_ you should extend these beans, to fill the id-bean from dependent entity fields. So, enhance the setter methods of this unique fields to fill the id-beans corresponding field, too.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class MyBean {
	@Id MyBeanId id;
	@Column MyType myUniqueField;
}

class MyBeanId {
	String field1;
	String myUniqueFieldId;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are other tools to generate your entities:

* Netbeans provide a generating plugin
* "Eclipse Dali"http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/dali/ on WTP package
* "Telosys-Tools":http://tools.telosys.org/ (includes an eclipse plugin)
* "MinuteProject":http://minuteproject.wikispaces.com/JPA2
* Kodo (probably now integrated into openjpa)

But these tools are not supported and discussed in _Nano.H5_

### Reverse engineering with OpenJPA

As on hibernate-tools it is difficult to set properties, openjpa provides lots of properties to assign the generation process for your project. The ant script _reverse-eng.xml_ shows some of these properties.

Some hints:
* don't define more than one persistence-unit in your persistence.xml
* constrain the _schema_ otherwise all schemats will be respected
* the provider should be set to _org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl_
* openjpa-2.3.0 is not able to find/generate primary keys --> no class can be generated! Please at least 2.4.0
* edit the *persistence.xml* and set the property *openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary* to  value="hsql(SupportsSchemaForGetTables=false)"

## Interactive attribute content

There are several possibilities to add interactive content to your page.

* Presenting an Attribute as one of:
	* Canvas (canvas filled through drawing informations of the attributes value)
	* SVG (svg can contain interactive content and can embed or reference bitmaps, "see tutorial": http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/interactive-svg-components
	* Javascript (attributes value contains javascript)
	* WebGL (attribute value as web-gl)
* Rich Client GUI interactions through WebSockets (see next chapter)

These attributes may be BeanAttributes, getting their content f.e. from a database - or virtual attributes getting their content from somewhere else.

## Rich Client GUI interactions through WebSockets 

The use of websockets and their internal javascripts is optional. Nano.h5 provides the following mechanisms to use websockets:

1. as application message service: providing status messages from main application 
2. as input assist: supporting the user with available values
3. as dependency listener: refreshing other dependent values after change a fields value or doing a mouse click on data like pictures
4. as dependency listener: refreshing other dependent values through calls of RESTful services
5. as file attachment transferrer: providing to transfer local content to the server
6. as restful service request: the attribute has to present an _iframe. the current user interaction event will be sent to the service - the result will be embedded into the iframe.
7. as chat system. Using the annotation @Chat on your entity will define the chat message and receiver

The main exception handler is connected to a WebSocketServer. All messages, sent through __Message.send(msg)__ are transferred to all connected child sessions. After getting the 'submit' event, a progress bar is shown.

### The applications message service

After user request - for example a forms submit - the application is doing some work with interaction to other servers like an application-server or a database. This may take long times, so the websocket connection is a comfortable way to show working status messages - with text and progressbar.

### Attributes input assist to show available values

Each attribute having an input-assist instance (on persistable attributes it is a DefaultInputAssist instance) tries to provide an input-assistance through the websocket connection. This is done through the NanoWebSocketServer combined with the WebSocketExceptionHandler.

### Dependency listeners to re-calculate their values after changing a source value

To refresh dependent values after changing a special value, do the following:
* create a new class, implementing _WebSocketDependencyListener.evaluate()_
* add an instance of this dependency listener to the special values change-handler.

available implementations:
* WebSocketDependencyListener
* WebSocketRuleDependencyListener

Example: creating a dependency listener

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BeanDefinition b = BeanDefinition.getBeanDefinition(org.anonymous.project.Person);
((AttributeDefinition)b.getAttribute("organisation")).changeHandler().addListener(new WebSocketDependencyListener(((AttributeDefinition)b.getAttribute("shortname")) {

    @Override
    protected Object evaluate(Object value) {
        //any new value...
        return "my-refreshed-value:" + Util.asString(value);
    }
});
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

more complex Example: creating a dependency listener

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
final BeanDefinition b = BeanDefinition.getBeanDefinition(org.anonymous.project.Person);
((AttributeDefinition)b.getAttribute("organisation")).changeHandler().addListener(new WebSocketDependencyListener(((AttributeDefinition)b.getAttribute("shortname")) {

    @Override
    protected Object evaluate(Object value) {
	    //new value of attribute 'organisation'
	    Object value = evt.newValue;
	    //here we set dynamically which attribute depends on changes
	    setAttribute(b.getAttribute("shortname"));
	    //the evt.source holds the changed bean value
	    IValueDefinition srcValue = (IValueDefinition)evt.getSource();
	    //here we get the old value of the dependent attribute 'shortname'
	    //through srcValue.getInstance() you could get all other values with Bean.getBean(srcValue)
	    Object lastAttributeValue = getAttribute().getValue(srcValue.getInstance());
	    //return the refreshed value for attribute 'shortname' 
	    return value + "/" + lastAttributeValue;
    }
});
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the _WebSocketRuleDependencyListener_ you set a rule name to call a specification rule for evaluate the new attribute value. This dependency listener can be embedded into the owning attributedefinition of the presentation xml file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    BeanDefinition b =
        BeanDefinition.getBeanDefinition(BeanClass.createBeanClass("org.anonymous.project.Person").getClazz());
    ((AttributeDefinition) b.getAttribute("name")).changeHandler().addListener(
        new WebSocketRuleDependencyListener<T>(b.getAttribute("shortname"), "shortname", "rule-shortname"));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Monitoring and refreshing a value through REST services and a Timer

If you use the _WebSocketServiceListener_ you can define the following properties:
* restfulUrl: url to a RESTful service
* parameter: name of the first methods parameter - assigned to the bean attributes value
* timer: through _createTimer(periodInSeconds)_ (xml-tag: _timer_) to do a scheduled client refresh.

### Transferring local file attachments

Simply set your beans attribute type to be an attachment. The client will use a file-selector to select your file. After selecting the file, this file will be sent to the application and the bean can access this file, stored inside the environments temp path.

Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BeanDefinition b = BeanDefinition.getBeanDefinition(MyEntity.class);
((AttributeDefinition)b.getAttribute("my-attribute-name")).getPresentation().setType(IPresentable.TYPE_ATTACHMENT);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Calling a RESTful service or a link to embed the result into an iframe

restful services can be added as attributes through a RestfulExpression. To do this on runtime, select any bean to configure it's type inside the bean-configurator.
There are two possibilities to add a new attribute.

#### The convenience to add a new attribute (through an expression)

Click the 'Add Attribute' button and do a double click on the 'Attribute-Expression' item. Enter an expression (see detail description on the next chapter) and Click 'Add Attribute' again to save the new attribute.

#### Adding a new Attribute - the long and detailed way

[[img src=beanconfigurator.png]]

Click the selector button ('...') on the attributes field, and click new in the following panel to create a new attribute. A default attribute will be created - click the assign button on the selection panel.

[[img src=attributeconfigurator-new.png]]

Now you are inside the new attribute definition. Click on the selection button for the field 'declaration' - there the attribute expression will be defined.

[[attribute-declaration-new.jpg]]

Enter an expression like

	@https://openstreetmap.org/search?
	
to create a url-expression attribute.

The expression declaration tries to evaluate the type of expression you input. The following types are identified:
	PathExpression (Example: person.address.city)
	SQLExpression (Example: ?select * from MYTABLE where...)
	RuleExpression (Example: see chapter 'The rule cover')
	URLExpression (Example: @http://openstreetmap.org/search/query={city})
	SimpleExpression (Example: http://openstreetmap.org/search/query=${city})
	
After you typed your attribute expression you can click the save- and assign- buttons to return to the main bean configuration panel. Clicking the save button here will persist the bean definition and you will find your new attribute at the end of presentation/MYBEAN.xml (..or .yaml).
	
The result should be the changed bean presenter in the directory MY-ENVIRONMENT/presenter:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   <attribute name="geonames.org">
      <attributeDefinition id="false" unique="false" doValidation="true" composition="false" cascading="false" generatedValue="false">
         <declaring class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.expression.URLExpression" declaringClass="org.anonymous.project.Address" type="de.tsl2.nano.bean.def.BeanDefinition$1">
            <expression><![CDATA[@geonames.org]]></expression>
         </declaring>
         <constraint type="java.lang.Object" nullable="true" length="-1" scale="-1" precision="-1"/>
         <description>geonames.org</description>
         <presentable class="de.tsl2.nano.h5.Html5Presentable" type="-1" style="-1" visible="true" searchable="true" nesting="false">
            <label>Address:@geonames.org</label>
            <description>Address:@geonames.org</description>
            <enabler class="de.tsl2.nano.action.IActivable$2" active="false"/>
         </presentable>
      </attributeDefinition>
   </attribute>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WebClient definition can be found in the specification folder as file 'geonames.org.xml':

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<webClient name="geonames.org" method="GET" urlRESTSeparators="false" valuesOnly="true" handleResponse="false">
   <operation>http://geonames.org/search.html?q=</operation>
   <contextKey>address</contextKey>
   <parameterNames length="1">
      <string>city</string>
   </parameterNames>
</webClient>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WebClient supports full RESTful access!

Another feature is to define a timer through _createTimer(periodInSeconds)_ (xml-tag: _timer_) to do a scheduled client refresh.

#### WebClient: The Expression for a service url

The expression for an URL can contain extended informations. The syntax is:
	http[s]?//.*<<(PUT|POST|DELETE)[:]<CONTENTTYPE>
	
The expression can contain url query arguments and it can end with '=' or the nano specific method/content-type description (e.g. "<<PUT:application/xml")


Examples:
	http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=						// it ends with '=', bean attributes (given as context) will be appended directly without names. no restful syntax will be used
	http://localhost:8080/myresource/								// a port is given, so it's not a public service. the response will be embedded with its content into the html page
	http://localhost:8080/myresource/<<PUT:application/json			// rest syntax will be used, method is PUT and content-type is application/json.
	http://localhost:8080/myresource/city/{city}/street/{street}/	// the attributes 'city' and 'street' will constrain the parameters in *parameterNames*
	
If your bean is something like:
	Address
		city
		code
		street
all three attributes will be appended as rest query parameters at the end. to change that, edit the address.xml tag: *parameterNames*. Or you give an expression holding something like {city} - this will be extracted as *parameterNames*.

## The content

If you have a method 'PUT', 'POST', you need a content to be posted. The content will be evaluated on running the RestfulExpression through a given context. If no *contentFromContext* was defined, the first context element (normally the bean-instance (e.g. an Address) will be used as content. You can define *contentFromContext* as relation from Address. E.g.: address.city. Then the value of address.city will be used as content. The content will be transformed as defined by content-type (mime-type, see: https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/Referenz:MIME-Typen).

Supported types are:
	application/xml
	application/json
	text/plain
	text/html
	image/jpeg
	image/png

### Technical details: How it works

there is a template file _websocket.client.js.template_ that will be filled and embedded into the response html. some of the declared functions are called by event handlers of input fields of this html. So, if someone changes the method names of that template, he has to change the dependent environment properties, defining this function names.

Example environment-property:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
websocket.inputassist.function=inputassist(event)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

so this function has to be implemented inside the template script:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...
function inputassist(e) {
	var code;
	if (e.keyCode) 
		code = e.keyCode;
	else if (e.which) 
		code = e.which;
	var text = e.srcElement.value + String.fromCharCode(code);
	var request = '@' + e.srcElement.id + ':' + text;
	console.log('sending input-assist request: \'' + request + '\'');
	socket.send(request);
}
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see, all messages will change attribute properties.

### Fulltext search with H2 or Lucene

The default database H2 provides full-text search through lucene or on its own. Go to the Administration panel (starting from the first panel after login), click the 'ScriptTool' button end enter:

	CREATE ALIAS IF NOT EXISTS FT_INIT FOR "org.h2.fulltext.FullText.init";
	CALL FT_INIT();
	CALL FT_CREATE_INDEX('PUBLIC', 'TEST', NULL);

Click the button 'Start'. This has to be done once - the fulltext-search is now initialized.
Now enter something like:
	SELECT T.* FROM FT_SEARCH_DATA('hello', 0, 0) FT, TEST T
	WHERE FT.TABLE='TEST' AND T.ID=FT.KEYS[0];

If you click the 'Query' button, this query will be saved as query to be shown in the starting bean-collector list.

## Developing, Deploying and Debugging

* [tsl2.nano code server](git://git.code.sf.net/p/tsl2nano/code tsl2nano-code)

If you change sources of a plugin, you should start ant script _2nano.xml_. This will generate all jars to a target directory and creates the product-version _tsl2.nano.h5.x.y.z.jar_ into the targets test directory _test.sample.h5_.

The version is read from _build.properties_ of nano.h5.

### Debugging

To debug your app or just the framework, you should enhance the logging output. Edit the file _logfactory.xml_ and add the text _debug_ to the attribute _standard_ of tag _logfactory_. This will enhance not only the logging output but the details of the tooltips of each html-field.

It is possible to enhance the logging level as start parameter, too. add the parameter *-Dtsl2.nano.log.level=debug*.

### Testing

To start the application in test mode, add the parameter *-Dtsl2.nano.test=true*. This will change the behaviour of creating new items. on test mode, all duty fields will be filled with default values to enable test engines save new entities without user input.

### Testing JPA-Providers and the persistence.xml

If you want to test some properties in the persistence.xml without letting _nano.h5_ generate it from template persistence.tml, change the environment property _app.login.save.persistence_ to _false_.

### Help on Html5

Normally, you don't have to create html-pages by yourself, but if you are interested in html5, have a look at the following tutorials/references:

* [W3C-Html5-Reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-html-markup-20130528/Overview.html)
* [Html-5.com](http://www.html-5.com/index.html)
* [Webkompetenz](http://webkompetenz.wikidot.com/docs:html-handbuch)
* [Html5 Poster](http://www.xhtml-lab.com)

To analyse the html-page in your browser, for example in your Chrome-Browser, you can analyse components by mouse-right-click on _analyse element_ to debug and change the current bean presentation.

### jar-library dependencies

* velocity-1.6-dep.jar: XmlUtil.transform (using CompatibilityLayer)
* TODO: describe all jars!

### Creating a new _NanoH5_ version

Change the following files, if you change a version number of any nano project:
* tsl2.nano.incubation/projects/*.properties
* tsl2.nano.h5/src/resources/build.properties
* tsl2.nano.h5/src/resources/run.bat

Run the script tsl2.nano.incubation/2nano.xml. un-comment the first entry of _refactore.clean_ before.

## Creating an own project

There are several ways to create an own project using this framework as base. We describe two of them - the first with an dependency injection (DI) mechanism, the second using the old class extending style.

### Implementing an own project through dependency injection (DI)

There are two java interfaces to be implemented. You can see them as plugin or feature definitions.
 
The interfaces

* de.tsl2.nano.h5.plugin.INanoPlugin
* de.tsl2.nano.h5.plugin.IDomDecorator

are used as entry points by the framework to visit all implementations and inspect or decorate the given arguments.
Through DI your implementation will be found and the implemented interface methods will be called directly after the framework has created new default objects/trees to be inspected or decorated.

#### Application Plugins/Inspectors

Your implementation of  _INanoPlugin_ works as application inspector, changing the default configuration, handling authentication, bean definitions, bean-presentation etc.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * NanoH5 Plugin interface to define an own NanoH5 Application through callbacks invoked on most important entry
 * points. All classpath-implmenetations of this interface will be found by the framework and will be invoked on the
 * instruction points.
 * <p/>
 * At least one implementation should have a main function calling
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Main.startApplication(NanoH5.class, null, args);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Each method will be called with parameters, pre-filled and provided by the framework.
 * <p>
 * To enhance the the Html-Output, see {@link IDOMDecorator}.
 * 
 * @author Tom, Thomas Schneider
 * @version $Revision$
 */
public interface INanoPlugin extends Plugin {
    /** do some inspections on authentication. The auth object is pre-filled */
    void onAuthentication(IAuthorization auth);

    /**
     * change the default properties of the application. see 'environment.xml' for a list of all keys and their defaults
     */
    void configuration(SortedMap<Object, Object> properties, Map<Class<?>, Object> services);

    /**
     * The Html page-builder defines the creation of each response. you must return an instance of pageBuilder (null
     * will result in errors)!
     */
    public <PAGE, OUTPUT, T extends IPageBuilder<PAGE, OUTPUT>> T definePresentationType(T pageBuilder);

    /**
     * for each bean type (belonging to an entity class) the default handling can be changed. the output can be found at
     * the presentation directory
     */
    void defineBeanDefinition(BeanDefinition<?> beanDef);

    /**
     * before an authentication, the properties for the jpa persistence.xml will be defined. You can change these
     * settings before a new session will be started
     */
    void definePersistence(Persistence persistence);

    /** before running the requested user interaction, you can inspect the action that will be called */
    void actionBeforeHandler(IAction<?> action);

    /** after running the requested user interaction, you can inspect the action that was called */
    void actionAfterHandler(IAction<?> action);

    /**
     * on creating a new session, the workflow / navigation stack is defined by loading from 'workflow.xml' or if not
     * found by providing all entity beans in a list. This workflow can be changed by your inspector.
     */
    void workflowHandler(IBeanNavigator workflow);

    void exceptionHandler(Exception ex);

    /** on each new http request, you can inspect and change the header, parameters and files */
    void requestHandler(String uri,
            Method m,
            Map<String, String> header,
            Map<String, String> parms,
            Map<String, String> files);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Html DOM Decorators

Your implementation of  _IDOMDecorator_ will be called on each html page creation. The DOM-Document, created by the framework will be given as parameter to be optional decorated / changed by your code.  
Through the given session object, you have access to the authentication informations, the current bean and the navigation stack of the current workflow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public interface IDOMDecorator extends Plugin {
    /** extends a prebuild DOM, given by Document - using informations on the current session */
    void decorate(Document doc, ISession<?> session);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you can use template generating framworks like velocity or thymeleaf.

For further informations and examples, have a look at chapter "Injecting own logic on the forms html DOM document"

#### The maven build for your application plugin

* Your maven build has to have a dependency to the artifact _tsl2.nano.h5_, provided by the maven central repository.
* If your implementation provides a java main method, this method has to be assigned to the manifest entry _Application-Class_
	* the maven build has to create a jar including all items of the _tsl2.nano.h5_ jar and all your own items

maven build:

###  Implementing an own project through framework class extensions

_Nano.H5_ is based on the framework _tsl2.common_ and it's bean package. The bean package provides a generic and comfortable way to describe your user interface. If the standards of _Nano.H5_ don't fulfil your needs, you can develop own beans on top of _Nano.H5_ - without creating special gui-elements or interaction, this will be done by the framework - generating html-pages through the _BeanPresentation_ implementation. Of course, this implementation is extendable, too. Have a look at chapter _Dependencies_ to know, which jar-files you should copy to the environment directory (f.e. _h5.sample_).

If you download and unpack _test.h5.sample_, you yield an eclipse project referencing the _tsl2.nano_ jar-files.

The implementation _Loader.java_ and _MyApp.java_ provide an own entry for the sample application. The _Loader_ only tells java to load _MyApp_. _MyApp_ overwrites three methods. Only _createBeanCollectors_ defines own beans and an own navigation stack.

Here is the implementation:

*Loader*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public class Loader extends AppLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Loader().start("my.app.MyApp", args);
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


*MyApp*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public class MyApp extends NanoH5 {
    private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(MyApp.class);

    /**
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public MyApp() throws IOException {
    }

    /**
     * @param ipport ip + port
     * @param builder
     * @param navigation
     * @throws IOException
     */
    public MyApp(String ipport, IPageBuilder<?, String> builder) throws IOException {
        super(ipport, builder);
    }

    @Override
    @SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
    protected BeanDefinition<?> createBeanCollectors(List<Class> beanClasses) {
        

        /*
         * create your own bean collectors as described in the next chapter
         */

		//...
		
        /*
         * define your own navigation stack
         */
        return beanCollector;
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        startApplication(MyApp.class, MapUtil.asMap(0, "http.connection"), args);
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Programmatical configuration

The next code pieces generate examples for all _nano.h5_ aspects. The generated xml-files are used in the specialized chapters as examples. You can put them all together in _MyApp.createBeanCollectors(..)_.

### Creating a workflow

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*
 * Sample Workflow with three activities
 */
    LinkedList<BeanAct> acts = new LinkedList<BeanAct>();
    Parameter p = new Parameter();
    p.put("project", true);
    p.put("prjname", "test");
    acts.add(new BeanAct("timesByProject",
        "project&true",
        "select t from Times t where t.project.id = :prjname",
        p,
        "prjname"));
    p = new Parameter();
    p.put("prjname", "test");
    acts.add(new BeanAct("organisation",
        "!organisation.activated",
        "select p from Organisation p where ? is null",
        p,
        "prjname"));
    p = new Parameter();
    p.put("organisation", "test");
    acts.add(new BeanAct("person",
        "organisation.activated & (!person.activated)",
        "select p from Person p where p.organisation = ?",
        p,
        "organisation"));
    Workflow workflow = new Workflow("test.workflow", acts);
    Environment.persist(workflow);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Creating a rule with sub-rule

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    /*
     * use a rule with sub-rule
     */
    LinkedHashMap<String, ParType> par = new LinkedHashMap<String, ParType>();
    par.put("A", ParType.BOOLEAN);
    par.put("x1", ParType.NUMBER);
    par.put("x2", ParType.NUMBER);
    Rule<BigDecimal> testRule = new Rule<BigDecimal>("test", "A ? (x1 + 1) : (x2 * 2)", par);
    testRule.addConstraint("x1", new Constraint<BigDecimal>(BigDecimal.class, BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal.ONE));
    testRule.addConstraint(Rule.KEY_RESULT, new Constraint<BigDecimal>(BigDecimal.class, BigDecimal.ZERO,
        BigDecimal.TEN));
    Environment.get(RulePool.class).add("test", testRule);

    //another rule to test sub-rule-imports
    Environment.get(RulePool.class).add("test-import",
        new Rule<BigDecimal>("test-import", "A ? 1 + �test : (x2 * 3)", par));

    BigDecimal result =
        (BigDecimal) Environment.get(RulePool.class).get("test-import")
            .run(MapUtil.asMap("A", true, "x1", new BigDecimal(1), "x2", new BigDecimal(2)));

    LOG.info("my test-import rule result:" + result);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Defining a query

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    /*
     * define a query
     */
    String qstr = "select db_begin from times t where t.db_end = :dbEnd";

    HashMap<String, Serializable> par1 = new HashMap<>();
    Query<Object> query = new Query<>("times.begin", qstr, true, par1);
    QueryPool queryPool = Environment.get(QueryPool.class);
    queryPool.add(query.getName(), query);

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Defining an action

### Annotatios: Enrich your beans with presentable informations

Mostly, you wont be able to change the beans directly. But if you have direct access to the entities, you may enrich them with presentable informations.

On your Entity you can add the following annotations:

* @ValueExpression: string representation and generic creation information
* @Attributes     : beans attribute filter and order
* @Presentable    : beans presentable informations

On your Entities methods you can enrich attribute definitions or define actions, that will be presented as buttons:

* @Presentable    : attributes presentable informations
* @Column         : table column presentable informations
* @Constraint     : attribute value constraints
* @RuleCover      : attribute cover (evaluating attribute properties through a rule) NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!
* @Actions        : non-attribute but action marker. declares a method as action, presented by a button.

Extended annotations have to be used with a kind of pre- annotation that is multiple: _@With_:

On your Entity (directly following a @With annotation): 
* Compositor      : creates a compositor panel for the entity (@With(CompositorAnnotationFactory.class))
* Query           : creates a view panel through a select (@With(QueryAnnotationFactory.class))
* VirtualAttribute: defines a new virtual attribute for the entity to show a calculated value (@With(VirtualAttributeAnnotationFactory.class))
* Specification   : defines a new rule, query, action, url to evaluate a value (@With(SpecificationAnnotationFactory.class))
* CSheet          : defines a new CSheet (like a primitive excel-sheet to be filled with value, expressions, sql-statements) (@With(CSheetAnnotationFactory.class))

On a getter method (directly following a @With annotation): 

* DependencyListener: usable to reference a rule calculating the new value for the observer, after a change on an observable (@With(DependencyListenerAnnotationFactory.class))
* Specification   : defines a new rule, query, action, url to evaluate a value (@With(SpecificationAnnotationFactory.class))

There is a helper class _ConstraintValueSet_ providing some useful value sets:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    public static final String ALLOWED_CLASSES = "ALLOWED_CLASSES:";
    /** provides all methods of current classloader */
    public static final String ALLOWED_METHODS = "ALLOWED_METHODS:";
    /** provides all fields of current classloader */
    public static final String ALLOWED_FIELDS = "ALLOWED_FIELDS:";
    /** provides all generated application classes */
    public static final String ALLOWED_APPCLASSES = "ALLOWED_APPCLASSES";
    /** provides all loaded beans */
    public static final String ALLOWED_BEANS = "ALLOWED_BEANS:";
    /** provides all loaded bean-attributes */
    public static final String ALLOWED_BEANATTRS = "ALLOWED_BEANATTRS:";
    /** provides all loaded bean-attributes (without bean prefix) */
    public static final String ALLOWED_BEANATTR_NAMES = "ALLOWED_BEANATTR_NAMES:";
    /** provides all generated application bean-attributes */
    public static final String ALLOWED_APPBEANATTRS = "ALLOWED_APPBEANATTRS";
    /** provides all files inside current ENV-path, matching given reg-exp postfix */
    public static final String ALLOWED_ENVFILES = "ALLOWED_ENVFILES:";
    /** reads from given fileName as postfix, and splits the data through '\n' */
    public static final String ALLOWED_FROMFILE = "ALLOWED_FROMFILE:";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of an Entity using the annotations:   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@Entity
@ValueExpression(expression="{name}: {timer} {status}")
@Attributes(names= {"name", "author", "priority", "timer", "exsecutios"})
@Presentable(label="Consilium")
public class EConsilium extends Consilium implements IPersistable<String> {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	
	String id;
	String name;
	
	public EConsilium() {
	}
	public EConsilium(String author, ETimer timer, Priority priority, EExsecutio... exsecutios) {
		super(author, timer, priority, exsecutios);
	}
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	@Presentable(visible=false)
	@Override
	public String getId() {
		return id;
	}
	public void setId(String id) {
		this.id = id;
	}
	public String getAuthor() {
		return author;
	}

	public void setAuthor(String author) {
		this.author = author;
	}

	@Presentable(visible=false)
	public Date getCreated() {
		return created;
	}

	public void setCreated(Date created) {
		this.created = created;
	}

	@Presentable(visible=false)
	public Date getChanged() {
		return changed;
	}

	public void setChanged(Date changed) {
		this.changed = changed;
	}

	public Priority getPriority() {
		return priority;
	}

	public void setPriority(Priority priority) {
		this.priority = priority;
	}

	@Presentable(visible=false)
	public String getSeal() {
		return seal;
	}

	public void setSeal(String seal) {
		this.seal = seal;
	}

	@Override
	@OneToOne @JoinColumn
	public ETimer getTimer() {
		return (ETimer) super.getTimer();
	}
	
	public void setTimer(ETimer timer) {
		this.timer = timer;
	}

	public void setStatus(Status status) {
		this.status = status;
	}

	@OneToMany(mappedBy="consilium", cascade=CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval=true)
	public Set<EExsecutio<?>> getExsecutios() {
		return (Set<EExsecutio<?>>) exsecutios;
	}

	public void setExsecutios(Set<EExsecutio<?>> exsecutios) {
		this.exsecutios = exsecutios;
	}

	@Override
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	
	 public void setName(String name) {
	 	this.name = name;
	 }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Example using the _@With_ annotation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@With(VirtualAttributeAnnotationFactory.class) @VirtualAttribute(name=AnnotationExtensionTest.MYVIRTUALATTRIBUTE, specificationType=SpecificationType.RULE, expression="myvirtualattribute")
@With(SpecificationAnnotationFactory.class) @Specification(name="myquery", specificationType=SpecificationType.QUERY, expression="select...")
@With(QueryAnnotationFactory.class) @Query(name="myquery", icon="icons/go.png")
@With(CompositorAnnotationFactory.class) @Compositor(baseType=Base.class, baseAttribute="name", targetAttribute="composition", iconAttribute="icon")
@With(CSheetAnnotationFactory.class) @CSheet(title="myCSheet", rows=3, cols=3, cells = {
    @CCell(row=0, col=0, value="1"), @CCell(row=0, col=1, value="=A1+5")
})
class BeanType {
    Composition composition;

    public Composition getComposition() {
        return composition;
    }
    public void setComposition(Composition composition) {
        this.composition = composition;
    }
}
class Composition {
    BeanType beanType;
    Base target;
    public BeanType getBeanType() {
        return beanType;
    }
    public void setBeanType(BeanType beanType) {
        this.beanType = beanType;
    }
    public Base getTarget() {
        return target;
    }
    public void setTarget(Base target) {
        this.target = target;
    }
}
class Base implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    String name;
    String icon;
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    @With(DependencyListenerAnnotationFactory.class) @DependencyListener(rule="myvirtualattribute", listenerType=ListenerType.BOTH, observables= {"name"})
    public String getIcon() {
        return icon;
    }
    public void setIcon(String icon) {
        this.icon = icon;
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### The Chat System

You can provide a simple chat system through a definition in one of your entities.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@Chat(receiver="to", message="message", attachment="attachment")
public class ChatMessage implements IPersistable<String> {
...
	public String getMessage() {
		return message;
	}
	public void setMessage(String message) {
		this.message = message;
	}
	@Column(name="sfrom", length=64)
	public String getFrom() {
		return from;
	}
	public void setFrom(String from) {
		this.from = from;
	}
	@Column(name="sto", length=64)
	public String getTo() {
		return to;
	}
	public void setTo(String to) {
		this.to = to;
	}
	public byte[] getAttachment() {
		return attachment;
	}
	public void setAttachment(byte[] attachment) {
		this.attachment = attachment;
	}
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you edit and save a bean of that type in your nano app, the value of attribute 'message' will be sent to receiver as defined in value of 'to' attribute.

## Performance

Generic features like authorization for actions and data, filtering of columns and field, loading bitmaps etc. may slow down the application performance. The following tips may increase the performance:

set the following *environment.xml* properties:

* extract all sub-jars from main jar 'nano.h5.xxx.jar'. nested jar loading is really slow.
* if you don't need data-permissions, disable check of data-permission: *check.permission.data=false*
* set log-level to info: *default.log.level=8*
* disable multiple field/column filter: *collector.use.multiple.filter=false*
* get only 50 lines per search: *service.maxresult=50*
* don't use the attribute pre-filter: *bean.use.beanpresentationhelper.filter=false*
* turn off replication: *use.database.replication = false*

## Android

The _nano.h5_ framework works on android systems, too. But upto this time I coudn't find a proper O/R mapper supporting full JPA 2.0 and providing an EntityManager through an persistence.xml file.

The O/R mappers *EBean* and *ORMLite* are able to work on JPA-annotations, but no *javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory* was implemented. The standard jpa persistence providers use libraries that don't work on android - or they have to many methods which causes the exception:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Dex Loader] Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536 
Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, the nano.h5 framework is useless on android systems at this moment.

Other restrictions on android:
* all libraries in your environment directory must contain dex-classes. you can't simply add a standard library without transforming it to *dalvik classes*.
* ant wont work, so
	* as hibernate doesn't work on android too, *hibernate-tools* as bean-jar generator is not usable. The same problem exists on openjpa!
* on android an error occurs creating an xml-file for authorization. perhaps an empty authorization file will be created resulting in an error on next application start.
* adding eclipse-link to the apk file results in error: _Unable to execute dex: method ID not in [0, 0xffff]: 65536_
	*  Your project is too large. You have to many methods. There can only be 65536 methods per application. see here https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7147#c6

## Tutorials

### Starting from beginning with a new project

#### Creating a new data model

##### Introduction

I've looked for free solutions to create a data model through a java application - or better through an online html5 application. UML-2 using stereotypes to define entity relationship informations would be my first selection. ArgoUML 0.34 is such a java application - but since its development was stopped, i preferred another tool, that is directly done to create ER models: The SQL Power Architect: http://www.sqlpower.ca/page/download?fileName=http://download.sqlpower.ca/architect/1.0.7/community.
All the found online tools have constraints, so they are not usable in a free way:

Here is a list of currently available browser solutions to create model graphs:

* https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools
	* http://www.jrromero.net/tools/jsUML2
	* Gliffy (https://www.gliffy.com/)
	* Creatly.com
	* Diagram.ly
	* LucidChart
	* MxGraph (jGraph)
	* Draw.io
	* PonyORM
	* Mogway ER Designer (Java Webstart, creates DDL) http://mogwai.sourceforge.net/erdesignerng/erdesignerng.jnlp
	
##### The Model

* Please downlad SQL Power Architect from http://www.sqlpower.ca/page/download?fileName=http://download.sqlpower.ca/architect/1.0.7/community.
* After extracting it and starting the architect.jar file, you can directly start modelling through a click on right mouse button and selecting 'new table'.
* Create your model (using 'T' for a new table and 'C' for a new column)
* Hit Menu 'Create SQL Script' using the defaults and saving the shown sql script into your tsl2.nano.h5 environment directory 'anyway' with name 'anyway.sql'.
* Go into this environment directory and start the script 'mda' with parameter 'anyway'.

## Database Providers and Dialects

There are defined ANSI SQL Standards, but most datbase providers use additional specific function sets. So, JPA providers like hibernate use distinguished database dialects on different database systems.

For a small and fast java database, providing most features of SQL-92, HSQLDB is the first selection. HSQLDB provides additional features to switch on compatibility mode for some dialects:
 - DB2				: SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX DB2 TRUE;
 - MySQL			: SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX MYS TRUE;
 - MS SQL Server	: SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX MSS TRUE;
 - Oracle			: SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX ORA TRUE;
 - PostGres			: SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX PGS TRUE;

These dialects can be switched on through the connection-url, too:
 - DB2				: ;sql.syntax_db2=true
 - MySQL			: ;sql.syntax_mys=true
 - MS SQL Server	: ;sql.syntax_mss=true
 - Oracle			: ;sql.syntax_ora=true
 - PostGres			: ;sql.syntax_pgs=true

This is useful if DDL generators create specific dialects - or simply for testing.

## FAQ Known Problems and some Solutions

* Performance going down:
	* to low memory for jvm:
		* enhance the maximum vm memory on start: change run.bat and add option '-Xmx1024m' on line starting with 'java'
	* non-persistable entities (annotated as @Entity, but not bound to any database table) are loading slow
		* remove that beans from bean list view: create a regular expression hiding that entities for property 'bean.class.presentation.regexp' in environment.xml (Example: _^(?!(.*MyBean1)|(.*MyBean2)).*_).
	* class-loading is slow through nested jar loading
		* extract all jar-files from tsl2.nano.h5.xxx.jar and copy them into the environments directory.
	* persistence provider has problems on specific beans:
		* use another persistence provider
* bean attributes have wrong default properties read from jpa annotations
	* if your beans don't decapitalize names the standard way, field names not be found. E.g. a name like MYName should decapitalized like this: MYName (not mYName!, see _Introspector.decapitalize(String name)_). If your beans can't be changed, you can switch the environment property _bean.attribute.decapitalize_ to _false_.
* Beans showing currencys with EURO can't be saved
	* Set the character encoding of your browser's current page to *UTF-8*. E.g. in Chrome: Menu=>Tools=>Encoding
* no datasource for Sqlite available - apache BasicDatasource uses JavaBeans what is not usable on android
* ORMLite (4.48) not usable through persistence.xml because no EntityManagerFactory/EntityManager implementation available
* hsqldb 1.8 is not able to do _select max(count(color)) from Colors group by color_
* hibernate3 is - on special circumstances - not able to load fields with empty ('') strings. This results in an __java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0__
* hibernate4 is not able to generate correct case-sensitive class-names if table-names contain '_'. Example: SYS_TABLE will result in class _SysTable_, but variables try to declare _Systable_.
* hibernate4 may not generate anything on databasename, schema or table having '_'
* hibernate-tools 4 needs slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar! other slf4j libraries will result in problems.
* If an Enum value overwrites a method (like _toString()_), the declaring class of this value is anonymous. serializing it through simple-xml will write the class with postfix perhaps _$1_. This can't  be de-serialized through simple-xml.
* Some array types can't be de-serialized through simple-xml.
* a field holding a collection is not enabled
	* on oneToMany relations a cascading type must be given to be enabled
* jpa-providers:
	* eclipse-link: nullpointer on java.net.URL on loading persistence.xml
		* eclipseLink loads the METAINF/persistence.xml through another classloader. the bean-jar file will be searched from META-INF/ parent directory
		* use prefix '!' to define, that no environment-prefix will be added. E.g. '!mybeans.jar'. to enable text-input on jarfile property, change environments 'app.login.jarfile.fileselector' to false.
		* persistable fields of type Date have to annotate a temporal type 
	* datanucleus: metamodel has to be statically generated and compiled before. this is done automatically on compiling the beans if the datanucleus libraries are present.
	* openjpa: all jar-file names are invalid:
		* openjpa needs the beans jar file packed into the main jar file!
		* dynamic class enhancement must be enabled (see https://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.2.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_pc_enhance.html)! start the jvm with option: _-javaagent:[path-to-extraced-openjpa-zip-file]/openjpa-2.x.x.jar_
		* openjpa properties: https://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.2.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_conf_openjpa.html
	* openjpa schema-tool does not create schema.xml for hsqldb:
		* in persistence.tml <property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="hsql(SupportsSchemaForGetTables=false)" /> hinzufuegen
		* see http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.3.0/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_dbsetup_dbsupport.html
	* ebean 3.3.2: "is not an enhanced entity bean. Subclassing is not longer supported in Ebean"
		* ebean versions after 2.8.1 don't support DynamicProxies any more. enhancing has to be done statically through maven-builds.
	* batoo-jpa: the jar-file has to have a protocol prefix like 'file:' (e.g.: file:./mybeans.jar). to enable text-input on jarfile property, change environments 'app.login.jarfile.fileselector' to false.
	* ebean 2.8.1: "@OneToMany MUST have Cascade.PERSIST or Cascade.ALL because this is a unidirectional relationship"
	* ormlite: "Generated-id field 'myID' in MyEntity can't be type STRING.  Must be one of: INTEGER INTEGER_OBJ LONG LONG_OBJ UUID"
	* ormlite: "No fields have a DatabaseField annotation in class org.anonymous.project.Address"
* SimpleXml: TransformationException on Lists
	* use ListWrapper instead of type List
* sometimes the mda.xml script does not compile the generated classes
	* use the script compilejar.cmd to compile the classes and create a generated-model.jar file
* sometimes the mda.xml script does not generate any sql file.
	* get the sql file from any other tool, start the h2 database manager on localhost:8282 and run the script inside
* java.lang.ClassCastException: org.hibernate.type.StringType cannot be cast to org.hibernate.type.VersionType
	* -> remove generated '@Version' annotation from java files
* no database-tables are created
	* -> be careful with your persistence definition: database-url, database, and schema must fit together. E.g. on a H2 url jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/PUBLIC, the SCHEMA must be PUBLIC, too!
* h2 database "java.io.ioexception: block not found in id"
	* -> you have changed the database structure. shutdown the h2 database before you add or change data
* java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.hibernate.boot.registry.classloading.internal.ClassLoaderServiceImpl.withTccl(Lorg/hibernate/boot/registry/classloading/internal/ClassLoaderServiceImpl$Work;)Ljava/lang/Object;
  * -> version conflict for hibernate between 4 and 5. remove the hiberate 5 libraries     

## Migrations

### Migration from 1.1.0 to 2.1.2

Lots of refactorings have been done, maven has replaced ant, java 8 is used now and a new plugin mechanism was added.

- Migration 1.1.0 -> 2.1.2
	- alle environment jar-files löschen - ausser dem generierten beans jar file
	- ClassFinder -> InputStream.readLine -> NPE <- install new jdk8 version
	- policy file problem <- java_home to jre
	- de.tsl2.nano.DefaultFormat -> de.tsl2.nano.core.util.DefaultFormat
	- de.tsl2.nano.messaging.ChangeEvent -> de.tsl2.nano.core.messaging.ChangeEvent

* perhaps use findjar.com before invoking maven-repository
* in jdk1.7 it is possible to close a classloader (unlocking and reloading jar-files is now possible). but the URLClassLoader doesn't use this mechanism yet.
