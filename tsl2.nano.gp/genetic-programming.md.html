# Genetic Programming with Evolutional Algorithms

This small module provides a package to run any algorithm like the *EvolutionalAlgorithm* with a given *fitness function*
to find the nearest solution of a problem that is defined by the fitness function.

Through a randomly mutated creation of a population of genoms (as sequence of numbers) each genom will be measured by the fitness function
to stop the algorithm, if a fitness (difference between exptected and calcluated value) converges to a minimum.

The module provides a generic fitness function *PolyglotFitnessFunction* to define the real fitness value inside any language like
javascript, phyton, etc.
